# Methodology of the InCiSE index {#sec-index-methodology}

As outlined in @sec-introduction, the InCiSE Index is a composite index formed
from a series of indicators, each of which is comprised of a set individual
metrics. The overall Index is the normalised and weighted average of the scores
of the constituent InCiSE indicators. The InCiSE indicators are themselves
normalised weighted averages of their individual metrics. The calculation and
modelling process to produce the Index is as follows:

1. Data processing:
    a. Data preparation [@sec-data-prep]
    b. Data quality assessment [@sec-data-quality]
    c. Country coverage selection [@sec-coverage]
    d. Imputation of missing data [@sec-imputation]
    e. Data normalisation [@sec-normalisation]
2. Calculation of the InCiSE indicators [@sec-calc-indicators]:
    a. Raw score calculated as a weighted average of the individual metrics
    b. Raw score normalised to produce final indicator score
3. Calculation of the InCiSE Index [@sec-calc-index]:
    a. Raw score calculated as a weighted average of the indicator scores
    b. Raw score normalised to produce final Index score

This chapter outlines the methodology for each of these different stages, and
finishes with a discussion of key data quality considerations
in [@sec-considerations] and comparisons over time in [@sec-time-series], while @sec-indicators-methodology provides details on
the specific methodology of each of the InCiSE indicators.

## Data preparation {#sec-data-prep}

The data for InCiSE comes from a wide range of independent sources, such as the
UN's E-Government Survey, Transparency International's Global Corruption
Barometer, and Bertelsmann's Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGIs).[^data]
The InCiSE partnership does not produce any of the source data itself or engage
in primary data collection.

[^data]: A full list of data sources can be found in the
[References](references.qmd) section at the end of this report.

The data for the 2019 edition of InCiSE is the latest available as of 30
November 2018. As well as the source metrics some additional data are collected
to aid in the imputation of missing data – this data does not directly
contribute to the scores and therefore is not included in the published results.

Some of the source data requires processing before it is suitable for use in
the InCiSE calculations and modelling. For example:

* *Binary/multiple categorical data:* some of the source data are binary
  measures (e.g. yes/no questions) or assess multiple categories (e.g. groups
  subject to whistleblower protection). In most cases this type of data is
  summed.

* *Individual level microdata:* InCiSE uses a custom analysis of the Programme
  for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)
  individual-level microdata to produce country scores. The Opentender data on
  procurement is on individual contracts, which also requires analysis to
  produce country scores.
 
* *Negatively framed data:* Some of the source data is based on negatively
  framed questions, where a higher score is poorer performance than a lower
  score. To align with other metrics, this data is inverted so that higher
  scores relate to better performance than lower scores.

* *Calculations against reference data:* For the inclusiveness indicator,
  women's representation in the civil service/public sector is compared to the
  labour market in general. Tax administration from the OECD is published as
  raw data. InCiSE uses rates based on these data which must therefore be
  calculated.

@sec-indicators-methodology outlines the underlying source data for each of the
indicators, and covers the specific transformations that are applied to the
source data. @sec-composite-metrics outlines the construction and calculation
of composite metrics.

When importing data to the InCiSE model, data is matched against a reference
list of 249 countries and territories produced by
@arel-bundock_countrycode_2018 using the 3-digit ISO 3166-1 alphanumeric codes.
Some source data natively uses the 3-digit ISO country codes, but some use the
2-digit ISO code, another code system, or a name of the territory (either the
official long/short name, or colloquial name). Therefore, as part of data
preparation, all country references are converted to the 3-digit ISO country
code.

## Data quality assessment {#sec-data-quality}

In order to provide a clearer understanding of the quality of the InCiSE Index,
a data quality assessment has been calculated and published alongside the
2019 edition. This assessment has a dual role: it is an important piece of
metadata that will help users of the InCiSE Index better understand the
results, but it has also been used to determine the country coverage of the
InCiSE Index. This section describes the method for conducting the data quality
assessment. The use of the assessment for country selection and weighting are
discussed in sections @sec-coverage and @sec-calc-index respectively, while a
wider discussion of data quality based on the results of the assessment is
provided at section @sec-considerations.

The data quality assessment is a purely quantitative exercise based on three
factors: data availability, the (non-)use of public sector proxy data, and
the recency of the data. The assessment does not include any subjective
evaluation of the methodology or the quality of the data sources that the
underlying data used by InCiSE comes from.

The data quality assessment also does not incorporate assessments of the
reliability or validity of indicator and index construction. Its purpose is to
provide an assessment of easily quantifiable characteristics of the data,
which can help interpretation of the InCiSE results for countries and of
the indicators.

The simple mean of the three measures is taken as the data quality score for
each country for each indicator. The 12 overall indicator quality scores are
then combined as a simple mean score to produce an overall data quality
assessment for each country.

For each indicator, the data quality assessment is based on three measures:
(1) the proportion of metrics with data; (2) the proportion of metrics that
have civil service specific data; and (3) the recency of the data. All three
measures take a simple assessment of whether data is missing or present as
their basis. However, each measure has different weighting rules for the data:

* *Data availability:* A missing data point fora metric with a
  within-indicator weight of 15% will give a greater penalty than a missing data
  point for a metric with a within-indicator weight of 5%.
* *Civil service data (1) or a public sector proxy (0):* Data points that come
  from public sector data are treated as equivalent to being missing.
* *Recency of the data:* The reference year of the metric is scaled from 0
  (for 2012, the earliest year) to 1 (for 2018, the latest year) and used as
  the weighting.[^recency]

[^recency]: For example a datapoint with a reference year of 2013 will be
weighted 0.1667, while one with a reference year of 2016 will be weighted
0.6667.

The country indicator data quality scores and overall data quality assessment
($DQA_{c,i}$) for a given country ($c$) and indicator ($i$) is calculated by
multiplying the missing data matrix of the metrics in the indicator for that
country ($d_{c,i}$) by each of: the within indicator weighting for the metrics
in the indicator ($m_i$), the proxy data status of each metric in the indicator
($s_i$), and the recency of each metric in the indicator ($r_i$). The resulting
products are summed and divided by three to give the mean data quality for that
country and indicator.

$$
DQA_{c,i} = \frac{{(d_{c,i} * m_i) + (d_{c,i} * s_i) + (d_{c,i} * r_i)}}{3}
$$

The overall data quality indicator for a country ($DQA_c$) is then calculated
as the sum of data quality assessment scores of that country for each indicator
divided by the number of indicators ($n_i$).

$$
DQA_c = \frac{\sum{DQA_{c,i}}}{n_i}
$$

The data quality assessment scores therefore have a theoretical range from 0
to 1. Where 0 represents there being no metrics available and 1 represents
there being data for all metrics, with all data representing the civil service
(i.e. not using a public-sector proxy) and all data relating to the latest
available year. @tbl-dqa-all illustrates the complex picture of
data quality across all countries and indicators.

The table shows how maximum data quality varies from 0.333 for capabilities,
where the available data is for a public sector proxy and the oldest data in
the model, to 1.000 for policy making, where all the available data relates to
the civil service and is at the latest available data.

The indicators for openness, fiscal & financial management and crisis & risk
management have good data quality (DQA score greater than or equal to 0.5) for
a very large number of countries. Other indicators (such as HR management or
tax administration) have a moderate number of countries with good data quality,
but have a large number of countries with poorer data quality. Finally, some
indicators (such as digital services or policy making) have data for only a
small number of countries, which is typically due to the source data covering
only OECD or EU members (or both).

## Country coverage selection {#sec-coverage}

For the 2017 Pilot edition of the InCiSE Index only two countries had data for
all 76 metrics, and a simple threshold of 75% data availability plus membership
of the OECD were used as the selection criteria for country availability.
However, analysis of the pilot showed (as @tbl-dqa-all shows) that there
is a mixed picture of data availability and quality across indicators which is
not reflected in this simple threshold. The data quality assessment outlined in
@sec-data-quality provides a more nuanced way to consider the variation of data
availability and quality, and is therefore used to determine which countries
are included in the final version of the index for the InCiSE 2019.

In determining country coverage, the InCiSE Partners have decided to use an
overall data quality assessment score of 0.5 or greater for the threshold for
country inclusion. 38 countries reached this score. Although two further
countries would be included if data quality scores were rounded to 1 decimal
place, these two countries have lower data availability (57% and 51% of all
metrics respectively), which is judged to be too low for reliable analysis.
Therefore, the 38 countries with a data quality score of 0.5 or higher
(when rounded to 2-decimal places) are included in the 2019 edition of the
InCiSE Index. This includes all 31 countries covered by the InCiSE pilot.

@tbl-dqa-incise provides an overview of the country-level data quality scores
for the group of 38 countries. The table shows that for most indicators the 38
countries have generally good data quality. However, for four indicators
(capabilities, crisis & risk management, digital services and procurement)
there are a small number of countries with no available data at all.

@tbl-dqa-countries1 provides a summary of the data quality assessment for all
38 countries selected for the 2019 edition of InCiSE, @tbl-dqa-countries2
provides the assessment for the five countries with the next highest data
quality score. One country (the United Kingdom) achieved the highest overall
data quality score of 0.757, followed closely by five others (Italy, Poland,
Sweden, Norway and Slovenia). Countries included for the first time in the
2019 edition of the Index are flagged with the "[new]" marker next to their
country name in @tbl-dqa-countries1.

Further discussion on data quality issues are provided at the end of this
chapter in section @sec-considerations, covering both the quality of the
indicators and interpretation of country level results from the InCiSE Index.

## Imputation of missing data {#sec-imputation}

As seen in Table @tbl-dqa-countries1 only one country has complete data (i.e.
100% of metrics). The average level of data availability is 86% across the 38
countries, and 7 of the included countries have data availability below the
75% threshold used for the 2017 Pilot, with the lowest level of data
availability being 65%. Of the 38 countries, 15 have one indicator with a data
quality score of 0 (i.e. no data at all for that indicator), two countries have
two indicators with a data quality score of 0 and one country has three
indicators with a data quality score of 0.

This presents issues for the analysis of the data and providing an effective
method for aggregating the metrics into indicators and an overall index.
The 2017 Pilot edition of InCiSE adopted two methods for imputation: multiple
imputation using linear regression and median imputation. For the 2019 edition
of InCiSE a decision has been made to move fully to a multiple imputation
approach, using the 'predictive mean matching' (PMM) technique of
@van_buuren_mice_2011. The PMM technique uses correlation – of both the values
and pattern of missing data – to identify for a country with missing data those
countries in the dataset that closely match it, and randomly select one of
those to replace the missing value. Following the approach set out by
@van_buuren_flexible_2018, for each missing value 15 imputations are generated
(each of which has also been iterated 15 times). A simple mean of these 15
imputation values is then calculated and used as the country's value in the
'final' dataset.

Imputation is handled on a per-indicator basis – in most cases imputation will
be solely from within the metrics of that indicator. However, a few indicators
have external predictors, either data from elsewhere in the InCiSE model or
from an external data source. Full details of the imputation approach for each
indicator is described in @sec-indicators-methodology.

## Data normalisation {#sec-normalisation}

As a result of coming from different sources, the underlying data that drives
the InCiSE model has a variety of formats: some are proportions or scores from
0 to 1 or 0 to 100; some are ratings on a scale, or the average of ratings
given by a set of assessors/survey participants; and some are counts. The
different formats of these data are not easily comparable, and cannot be
directly averaged together to produce a combined score. In order to facilitate
the comparison and combination of data from different sources, the metrics are
normalised so that they are all in a common format.

There are a number of normalisation techniques that could be used. A useful
discussion of the different methods is provided in the @oecd_handbook_2008
Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators. The InCiSE Index uses min-max
normalisation at all stages, as this maintains the underlying distribution of
each metric while providing a common scale of 0 to 1. The common scale is of
particular benefit, as it helps achieve InCiSE's goal of assessing relative
performance. In the min-max normalisation 0 represents the lowest achieved
score and 1 represents the highest achieved score. It is therefore important
to note that scoring 0 on a particular metric, indicator or the index itself
does not represent poor performance in absolute terms, nor does scoring 1
represent high performance in absolute terms. Rather the country is either the
lowest or highest performing of the 38 countries selected.

The min-max normalisation operates via the following mathematical formula:

$$
m_c = \frac{x_c-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}
$$

For a metric for a given country its normalised score ($m_c$) is calculated as
the difference of the country's original score ($x_c$) from the metric's
minimum score ($x_min$) divided by the range of the metric's scores (the
difference of the metric's maximum score ($x_max$) from the metric's minimum
score ($x_min$).

## Calculation of the InCiSE indicators {#sec-calc-indicators}

Once the data has been processed, missing data imputed, and the metrics
normalised, the InCiSE indicators can be calculated. There are two stages to
the calculation of the indicators: the weighting of the metrics into an
aggregate score, and the normalisation of that score.

As outlined in @fig-datamodel, the InCiSE data model first groups metrics into
themes before aggregating into the indicator scores themselves. These themes
are purely structural and scores for them are not computed. The raw score for
an indicator follows this formula:

$$
i_c = \sum{(m_{i,c}*w_m*w_t)}
$$

A country's raw score for an indicator ($i_c$) is calculated as the sum of the
product of each metric within the indicator for that country ($m_{i,c}$) with
the weight of that metric within its theme ($w_m$) and the weight of that
theme within the indicator ($w_t$). The weighting structure for each indicator
is listed in detail in @sec-indicators-methodology. After the raw scores are
calculated they are normalised as described in @sec-normalisation above.


## Calculation of the InCiSE Index {#sec-calc-index}

The InCiSE Index is an aggregation of the InCiSE indicators. Ideally, the
indicators would be combined equally, however in producing the 2017 Pilot
edition the InCiSE Partners felt it important to consider relative data
quality. In the 2017 Pilot this was done by placing a lower weight on the
indicators measuring 'attributes' than those measuring'functions', as the
four attribute indicators were considered to generally have lower data quality
than those measuring functions. The 2019 edition builds on this approach to
weighting by using the results of the data quality assessment (section
@sec-data-quality).

For this approach to weighting, two-thirds of the weighting is allocated on an
equal basis, while one third is allocated according to the outcome of the data
quality assessment. The weight for an indicator is calculated as follows:

$$
w_i = \left(\frac{2}{3}*\frac{1}{n_i}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}*Q_i\right)
$$

Here the indicator weight ($w_i$) is equal to the product of two-thirds and
the equal share (1 divided by $n_i$, the number of indicators; i.e. 1/12) plus
the product of one-third and the data quality weight for the indicator ($Q_i$).
The data quality weight is calculated first by summing the data quality scores
of the 38 selected countries for the indicator. The indicator's data quality
sum is then divided by the sum of all indicator data quality scores, in essence
providing a score that represents that indicator's share of the total data
quality for the 38 countries selected. The resulting weights are shown in
Table @tbl-ind-weights.

A country's overall raw index score ($I_c$) is thus calculated as the sum of
the product of the normalised indicator scores for the country ($i_c$) with the
indicator weights ($w_i$):

$$
I_c = \sum{(i_c * w_i)}
$$

After calculating the raw index scores, they are then are normalised as
outlined in @sec-normalisation, resulting in the overall index scores for the
2019 edition of InCiSE.

## Data quality considerations {#sec-considerations}

Sections @sec-coverage and @sec-calc-index illustrate how the data quality
assessment described in section @sec-data-quality is used within the InCiSE
model for country selection and indicator weighting.

The assessment can also be used to help interpret the results of the InCiSE
Index, both in terms of the quality of the indicators and for country results.

### Quality of indicators

The data quality assessment conducts three checks for each indicator: the
availability of metrics, the (non-)use of wider public sector data as a proxy,
and the recency of the data. @tbl-dqa-meta summarises the results of these
three checks for each of the indicators.

As discussed in sections @sec-coverage and @sec-imputation there are four
indicators where at least one country is missing all data for the indicator.
Conversely, there is only one indicator (policy making) where all 38 countries
have all data available. When it comes to the use of public sector proxy data,
there are six indicators where all the data is not a public sector proxy,
giving the indicators a maximum proxy data score of 1, and only two indicators
(capabilities and digital services) where all the data relates to the civil
service and is not public sector proxy which means their maximum proxy score
is 0. The recency calculation is a relative assessment where the oldest data
(2012) scored 0 and the most recent data (2018) scored 1 – here we see that
only one indicator (policy making) is composed solely of 2018 data and again
only one indicator (capabilities) is composed solely of 2012 data.

number of countries that achieve the maximum overall data quality score for
each indicator. For policy making all 38 countries score achieve the maximum
score, while for integrity only 14 countries achieve the maximum score.

Besides integrity, three other indicators (crisis & risk management, fiscal &
financial management, and procurement) have less than 20 countries achieving
the maximum score, while three indicators besides policy making have more than
30 countries achieving the maximum score (HR management, inclusiveness, and
regulation).

The indicator data quality scores can also be used to create a data-driven
red-amber-green (RAG) rating for data quality. Using the mean overall data
quality scores for each indicator from the 38 countries selected for the 2019
edition of InCiSE, a 'green' rating is assigned to those with a score of 0.75
or higher, 'amber' to those with a score between 0.25 and 0.75, and 'red' to
those with a score below 0.25.

However, the data quality assessment does not consider the reliability and
validity of each indicator's construction and therefore says nothing on how
well the indicator represents the concept it is trying to measure. Instead,
these data-driven RAG ratings can be combined with a subjective assessment of
wider data quality concerns to make an overall assessment of the general
'quality' of each indicator. @tbl-rag-rating shows the data quality assessment
of each indicator alongside a high-level qualitative assessment of the
indicator and a 'final' subjective RAG rating for the indicator.

Five of the indicators have a mean data quality score of 0.75 or higher,
earning them an initial 'green' rating. Of these indicators, three retain their
green rating after wider considerations of the quality of the indicators are
taken into account, meaning that these indicators are considered to provide
broad and robust coverage of their respective concepts. Two of the five are
demoted from green to amber, reflecting concerns about whether the indicators
are sufficiently broad.

Six of the indicators have an initial 'amber' rating. Five of these indicators
retain their rating, meaning they may only provide partial coverage of the
underlying concept or be heavily reliant on one particular data source or type
of data. One of the six is demoted from amber to red, reflecting concerns that
the indicator provides limited coverage of the underlying concept.

One indicator has an initial 'red' rating, which is driven largely by its lack
of recent data and being solely composed of public sector proxy data. Finally,
the social security function, which was included in the 2017 Pilot, is given a
'red' rating following its removal from the 2019 edition of InCiSE due to data
quality concerns. This change is discussed further in @sec-changes and
@sec-future-development.

### Quality of country-level results

Country-level data quality has already been considered to some degree, through
the determination of country selection in @sec-coverage. However, as with the
quality of indicators, the results of the data quality assessment can be used
to show the relative quality of the selected countries, which can help improve
interpretation of the results of the InCiSE Index.

@tbl-dqa-grade presents a detailed overview of the data quality by country.
Each country has been given an overall data quality letter "grade" based on its
overall data quality score, and for each indicator each country has been given
a "RAG" rating.

The overall data quality grades are allocated as follows based on a country's
data quality score rounded to 2 decimal places:

* **A+** for those countries that achieve the highest overall data quality
  assessment score (i.e. a data quality score of 0.75 when rounded to 2
  decimal places)
* **A** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.7
  but less than 0.75
* **B** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.65
  but less than 0.7
* **C** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.6
  but less than 0.65
* **D** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.5
  but less than 0.6
 
For the indicators, a four category "RAG+" rating system is adopted. The data
quality scores have been normalised (using min-max normalisation) by indicator:

* A 'green' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator
  data quality score of 1 – the country has the best possible data for this
  indicator.

* An 'amber' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator
  data quality score of greater than or equal to 0.5 – the country's data
  quality is at least half as good as the 'best' possible data for that
  indicator.

* A 'red' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator
  data quality score of less than 0.5 – the country's data quality is less than
  half as good as the'best' possible data for that indicator.

* An 'X' rating is given to those countries which have no data at all for
  that metric – that all of the country's scores for the metrics in that
  indicator have been imputed.

@tbl-dqa-grade reveals interesting patterns in data quality:

* Six countries are given an "A+" rating – one has full data for all indicators
  (i.e. all indicator rated 'green'), while the other five have just one
  indicator where they have an 'amber' rating.
* Eight countries achieve an "A" rating – they have generally good coverage of
  data but typically have two or three indicators rated 'amber' or 'red", only
  one country has an indicator where all data for that indicator has been
  imputed (rated'grey').
* Seven countries achieve a "B" rating for data quality – these countries have
  a greater degree of 'amber' and 'red' rated indicators, typically four. All
  but one country has at least one 'red' rated indicator, one country has one
  indicator fully imputed while another has two indicators fully imputed.
* Ten countries achieve a "C" rating for data quality – all countries have at
  least one 'red' rated indicator and eight of the countries have at least one
  indicator fully imputed.
* Seven countries achieve a "D" rating for data quality – all countries both
  have at least one indicator fully imputed and one indicator rated 'red',
  four countries have at least four indicators rated 'red'.

## Comparisons over time {#sec-time-series}

The InCiSE project is still in its infancy, and the methodology for the 2019
Index has built substantially on the foundations of the 2017 Pilot – most of
the metrics used in the 2017 Pilot have continued to be used in the 2019
edition. Of the 70 metrics in the 2017 Pilot that are directly comparable to
the 2019 edition, 33 have since had updates which are incorporated into the
model.

In addition to the 70 metrics carried over from the 2017 Pilot, a further 46
metrics have been incorporated into the InCiSE methodology, bringing the total
number of metrics for the 2019 model to 116. Most of these additional metrics
(30) are from existing sources. Some have been collected multiple times, but
some are new and have no previous data collection. Changes are summarised
in @sec-changes.

A further consideration for comparisons over time is the need to deal with
different reference dates and frequencies of updating.

Some data is updated on an annual basis while others are on two-year,
three-year, or longer update cycles. For example, the data for capabilities
has not been updated since it was first collected in 2012. These differing
cycles are the function of a variety of different factors, such as an
appreciation of the pace of change within a given topic area or the funding
and resourcing of the data producers.

As outlined in @sec-imputation, the InCiSE model uses imputation methods which
use statistical techniques to provide an estimate of a country's missing data.
While the imputation is based on predictive methods, it is not a firm
prediction of what a given country would have scored, but better understood as
indicative. The imputation methods may change between years, and the
relationships in the observed data (from which the imputation is drawn) may
also change, limiting the reliability of comparing data imputed in one year
with data imputed in another year.

It may also be the case that at one time point a country did not have data for
a given metric but then has data at a later time point (or vice versa). This
would mean that for one point the metrics would have been imputed.

Comparing a score based on 'real' data with one based on imputed estimates is
unlikely to be reliable. In addition, as the methodology for InCiSE develops,
future versions of the InCiSE Index could adopt back-/forward-casting (i.e.
using results from different time points) to improve the quality of the
imputation methods. This would also make time-series comparison more
complicated or less feasible.

Finally, consideration should be given to the changing country composition.
The 2017 Pilot covered 31 countries, while the 2019 edition covers 38
countries. As outlined in section @sec-normalisation, the data is normalised
so that country scores are relative to the group of countries selected. This
again means it is not possible to directly compare scores from one edition of
InCiSE to another as the scores are related to the specific data range and
country set used for that edition.

As a result of these varied challenges, the InCiSE Partners have decided not
to include any comparisons between the 2017 Pilot and the 2019 edition of the
InCiSE Index.

Furthermore, the Partners strongly advise against any direct or indirect
comparisons being made beyond references to changes in the underlying source
data itself (i.e. before the data is imported into the InCiSE data model,
processed, imputed and normalised).
