# Future development {#sec-future-development}

The 2019 index is the second edition of the InCiSE project, following the
pilot edition published in 2017. The 2019 edition builds on and strengthens
the methodology of the pilot edition. The InCiSE Partners have used a
combination of stakeholder feedback, continued engagement with data providers
and further desk research to develop the methodology for the 2019 edition of
the InCiSE Index.

Given the frequency of data updates and to provide suitable time to reflect
on each edition's results, we propose that future editions of the InCiSE Index
are repeated on a biennial timescale. This chapter sets out considerations for
future development of the InCiSE methodology.

## Social security administration {#sec-future-ssa}

The InCiSE framework (described in @sec-incise-framework) identifies social
security administration as one of the constituent functions of an effective
central civil service, and the 2017 Pilot edition of the InCiSE Index included
an indicator for social security administration. The indicator was based on a
single metric, which was the administrative costs of social protection as a
proportion of total social protection expenditure. Feedback from the pilot
edition included a critique of this metric, saying it was unsuitable given the
inclusion of state provided healthcare which varies significantly across
countries. Furthermore, the data was available solely for European Union
member states, so data for non-EU countries was imputed based on correlated
perception measures from the Quality of Governance study used elsewhere in
the InCiSE model.

Exploration of the source data did not identify an appropriate method to
exclude healthcare costs from the calculations. A review of further data
sources identified neither alternative metrics that included non-EU countries
nor imputation predictors with a closer intellectual or theoretical
relationship to the indicator's conceptual basis.

It was therefore decided that the social security indicator should be removed
from the 2019 edition of InCISE. For future editions of the InCiSE Index, we
will continue to explore whether there is suitable data to reintroduce a
social security indicator.

## Functions and attributes not yet measured {#sec-future-notmeasured}

In addition to social security, four of the functions and attributes
identified in the InCiSE framework have not been measured in either edition
of the index: IT for officials, internal finance, staff engagement, and
innovation. No suitable data has been identified since the pilot that would
allow for measurement of these four potential indicators. Future editions of
the InCiSE index will continue to explore whether suitable data exists to
introduce indicators for these four areas.

## Functions and attributes already measured {#sec-future-measured}

The 2019 edition of InCiSE has used an additional 46 metrics compared to the
2017 Pilot: six form the new procurement indicator and 40 are distributed
across the existing indicators measured in the 2017 Pilot. 

While this has strengthened a number of indicators, as @tbl-rag-rating shows
only three of the indicators have been given a final 'RAG' rating of green
(data quality score of 0.75 or more). @tbl-indicator-future below provides some
considerations for future improvements of each of the indicators measured in
the 2019 edition of InCiSE, with amber or red 'RAG' ratings.

## Extending country coverage {#sec-future-country}

While coverage of the InCiSE results has increased from the 31 countries in
the 2017 Pilot to 38 in the 2019 edition, the group of countries remains
broadly homogeneous, made up of OECD and EU member countries with high or
upper-middle incomes. Future editions of the InCiSE Index will continue to use
the data quality based approach to country inclusion set out in @sec-coverage,
however this requires greater data availability for non-OECD/EU countries.

There are a number of potential options, such as creating regional versions
of the InCiSE Index using existing multi-country data collections for
different regions (but for which either OECD or EU countries are not members).
Alternatively, subsets of the existing InCiSE Index could be created as some
indicators have wider data coverage than others.

The InCiSE Partners are committed to identifying ways to increase coverage,
and have conducted two short studies of how the InCiSE framework applies in
Brazil and Nigeria to inform future thinking. 

While extending country coverage will generate a greater set of results,
careful consideration will be needed on developing alternative versions of the
index and how (if at all) to compare between them.
