# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

This report sets out the methodology for the 2019 edition of the International
Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) Index project. It provides an explanation
of the high-level principles underlying the development of the InCiSE Index,
the overarching methodology for the Index's calculation, the methodology for
each of the constituent indicators that make up the Index, and documents the
methodological changes made following the 2017 Pilot edition of the index. 

## Why InCiSE is needed {#sec-why-needed}
An effective civil service can play a vital role in determining a country's
progress and prosperity. But what constitutes an "effective civil service"?
The functions of the central government are not always directly comparable to
other organisations in a given country. Thus, international comparisons of
government and civil service activity are often sought. 

InCiSE aims to define "effectiveness" more extensively than previous literature,
drawing on a wide range of existing international data sources to bring together
a set of indicators, each measuring a different dimension of civil service
effectiveness. These indicators are then used to produce a composite (overall)
score. This creation of a new and concise set of civil service effectiveness
indicators therefore serves as: 

* An accountability tool: allowing citizens, government officials, and
  politicians to establish clearly and concisely how well their civil service
  is performing. 
* A performance improvement tool: enabling senior decision makers to see
  the countries which perform best in each area, and therefore learn from them. 

InCiSE has been developed following a literature review and in consultation
with many experts, including academics from schools of government, think-tanks
that monitor government effectiveness, international organisations, senior
civil servants (past and present) and subject matter experts. InCiSE has also
been the subject of an independent, international peer review process. The 2019
edition of InCiSE has also benefited from the feedback collected and provided
since the publication of the 2017 Pilot. 

## Defining the civil service {#sec-define-civil-service}

Civil service effectiveness is well recognised in academic, international and
practitioner communities as a highly complex area for analysis. As well as data
limitations and the need to take account of country context factors, analysts
are also faced with differing views on the definitions of both "civil service"
and "effectiveness". The scope, responsibilities, and structure of the civil
service vary across countries, creating the need to establish exactly what is
being assessed, and how. In defining the civil service there are a number of
possible approaches to take: 

* First, a civil service can be defined by function: a narrow view of the civil
  service through this definition focuses on the central, "upstream" agencies
  which set policy direction and procedural regulation for "downstream"
  agencies. The broader view encompasses agencies responsible for service
  delivery. 
* Second, a civil service can be defined by national accounts: this perspective
  sees the civil service as made up of entities which are owned by the
  government, and whose financial reporting places them within the System of
  National Accounts (SNA) category of General Government.
* Third, a civil service can be defined by employment regimes: under this
  definition, civil service entities are limited to those which are required to
  hire most employees under the civil service law, and those using other legal
  employment regimes are excluded. 

However, conceptual and practical problems arise under each of these
definitions. For example, staff commonly referred to as "civil servants" do not
always have legally distinct employee contracts; the SNA definition is
inconsistent with the views of many practitioners and researchers; and each
alternative conception results in a large and unwieldy group of agencies. 

InCiSE therefore takes a fourth and alternative approach, defining the scope of
‘civil services' by outlining and measuring performance on the core functions
of civil services; the parts which can generally be classified as civil service
in every country. This approach leads to a focus on (i) functions which deliver
services or affect citizens directly and (ii) public management and policy
functions carried out in the centre of government.

The unit of analysis of interest for the InCiSE Index is the civil service,
rather than the public sector more generally. InCiSE also focuses on civil
service at the central/federal level – the highest level of government in a
country/state – rather than at the regional or local level. Even with these
parameters, isolating civil service performance with currently available data
is still difficult, particularly given the varying sizes and shapes of civil
services internationally.

## The InCiSE framework {#sec-incise-framework}

The purpose of the InCiSE framework is to define a common approach for assessing
the effectiveness of a civil service, in a way which could realistically enable
international data to be collected to measure against it. Whilst there are many
alternative ways to define civil service effectiveness, the framework outlined
here is informed by evidence and set out in such a way that if a civil service
scores highly against it, it is reasonable to conclude that this civil service
is high-performing relative to its international counterparts. 

Our approach to deriving a common framework was to:

* Specify and adhere to a set of principles to inform the development of the
  framework:
    * Coherent – identifying the key elements and drivers of effective public
      administration
    * Comprehensive – covering all relevant aspects and drivers of the
      performance of public administration
    * Actionable – offering genuine insights into what drives excellent public
      administration that can be implemented
    * Transparent – a clear methodology and assessment process to ensure
      credibility, robustness, and replicability
    * Feasible – it is possible to collect data for a large group of countries
      at reasonable cost
* Draw on evidence to identify key features of a draft
  framework which was then extensively tested through consultation. 
* Build on existing indicators and data where possible, striving to develop
  a more comprehensive framework capturing all aspects of civil service
  effectiveness.
* Refine the framework through consultation with a number of experts,
  including academics, think-tanks, international organisations,
  civil servants (both past and present) and subject experts. 

A common approach for assessing organisational effectiveness is to think in
terms of inputs, outputs, and outcomes. However, this is appears less
attractive when considering civil services and the public administration-type
functions they provide. While output and outcome measures may have the
advantage of cutting through conceptual uncertainty, they can be problematic
in this area for three reasons: 

1.  Outputs and outcomes can be affected by external factors, making it
    difficult to isolate the contribution of the civil service. 
2.  Measuring outputs and their value can be methodologically problematic,
    particularly as many public sector outputs are provided free at the point
    of consumption.
3.  Focusing on outputs and outcomes means that normative and procedural
    concerns which are also relevant to effectiveness can be ignored. 

Given these concerns, the preferred approach here is to focus on the
effectiveness of the procedures within the civil service which (often
indirectly) affect outcomes. The framework's approach is therefore more process
focused and output focused, as outlined in @fig-framework. An advantage of
choosing process-based indicators is that they are more instructive for
potential performance improvements – it is processes that are ultimately
changed to increase effectiveness. 

Although procedural definitions also come with problems (they may not actually
correlate with positive outcomes, for example) certain procedural measures
remain at the core of any measure of effectiveness. Where there is evidence to
support the relationship between procedures and positive outcomes, procedures
may also be intrinsically beneficial. For example, meritocracy of recruitment
procedures in the civil service are important because there is broad agreement
that such procedures and outcomes are associated with an effective civil
service. However, the extent to which recruitment processes reward merit is
also important in the principle of fairness which is valued in itself. 

![The InCiSE Index Framework](figures/incise_framework.png){#fig-framework}

The InCiSE framework, shown in @fig-framework, defines the core characteristics
of an effective civil service. To do this, it assesses effectiveness on the
basis of two interrelated dimensions: 1) the delivery of its core functions and
2) an underlying set of attributes which are important drivers of effectiveness
across all parts of the civil service. Collectively the functions and
attributes are called ‘indicators' within the InCiSE model.
@sec-technical-approach describes in more detail how the framework is
implemented as a statistical
model. 

**Functions**: On one side, civil services deliver a set of central executive
functions for ministers. These may help to formulate policy for the country
(the effects of which are borne by citizens). On the other side, the services
interact more directly with citizens through the delivery of services such as
tax administration. Finally, in the centre, supporting these core external
functions, are mission support functions such as HR management or IT services
for officials. By looking across all three types of function, the aim is to
measure how well civil services deliver the core elements of their roles. The
functions identified by the InCiSE model are: 

* *Policy making:* The quality of the policy making process, including how
  policy is developed and coordinated across government and monitored during
  implementation.
* *Fiscal and financial management:* The quality of the budgeting process and
  the extent to which spending decisions are informed through economic
  appraisal and evaluation. 
* *Regulation:* The extent and quality of regulatory impact assessments and
  the degree of stakeholder engagement involved in them.
* *Crisis and risk management:* The effectiveness with which the government
  engages the whole of society to better assess, prevent, respond to and
  recover from the effects of extreme events.
* *Procurement:* The extent to which the procurement process is efficient,
  competitive, fair, and pursues value for money.
* *HR management:* The meritocracy of recruitment and the extent to which civil
  servants are effectively attracted, managed and developed.
* *IT for officials:* The extent to which civil servants have the technology and
  digital tools to work efficiently.
* *Internal finance:* The extent to which civil service operations are supported
  by well-managed and efficient finance systems, particularly on the alignment
  of finance with the business strategy and the level of civil servant
  satisfaction with finance support.
* *Tax administration:* The efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection
  (at the central/federal level).
  Social security administration: The efficiency and effectiveness of
  social security administration (at the central/federal level). 
* *Digital services:* The availability and usability of national-level digital
  public services. 

**Attributes:** Every civil service also has an underlying set of attributes
which are important drivers of how effectively they deliver core functions.
These attributes should apply to all parts of the civil service and are not
specific to particular parts or functions. The inclusion of attributes in the
framework is based on both a normative and a positive judgement: civil
services should aim to cultivate and demonstrate these attributes as they are
commonly (but not necessarily universally) understood as aspects of best
practice, and the included attributes should generally be determinants of
performance across all functions. 

* *Integrity:* The extent to which civil servants behave with integrity, make
  decisions impartially and fairly, and strive to serve both citizens and ministers. 
* *Openness:* The regular practice and degree of consultation with citizens to
  help guide the decisions we make and extent of transparency in our
  decision-making. 
* *Capabilities:* The extent to which the workforce has the right mix of skills.
* *Inclusiveness:* The extent to which the civil service is representative of
  the citizens it serves. 
* *Staff engagement:* Staff levels of pride, attachment and motivation to work
  for their organisation.
* *Innovation:* The degree to which new ideas, policies, and ways of operating
  are able to freely develop. 

The 2019 edition of InCiSE measures 12 of the 17 functions and attributes
defined by the framework. @sec-indicators-methodology provides further detail
of the definition and measurement of each of these indicators. Four of the five
indicators (IT for officials, internal finance, staff engagement, and
innovation) are not included because it has not been possible to identify
suitable or sufficient data for cross-country measurement. One of the five
indicators (social security administration) was measured in the 2017 Pilot but
has been depreciated due to data quality concerns.

## The InCiSE data model {#sec-incise-datamodel}

The InCiSE Index is based on a framework that describes the various components
of an effective civil service. The Index operationalises this framework by
measuring a series of indicators that correspond to the different components of
the InCiSE framework. The overall InCiSE Index results are a composite of the
indicator scores. In turn the indicators are split into themes, which describe
important sub-divisions of the indicator. Scores for these themes are not
computed but the theme structure is part of the weighting used in the
calculation of the indicator scores. The themes within an indicator are
represented by individual metrics, which ideally measure tangible qualities of
the civil service that can be acted upon or influenced by senior officials.
Most of the InCiSE metrics are single data points published by the data source
providers, however some metrics are calculated from multiple data points.
@fig-datamodel outlines the "data model" used by InCiSE, showing how individual
data points from the external data sources combine to form the metrics,
indicators and composite index of InCiSE.

InCiSE is not intended to measure inputs (e.g. money/resources) or public policy
outputs (e.g. unemployment benefits paid; taxes collected) or citizen outcomes
(e.g. life expectancy, GDP per capita, citizen wellbeing), as these are
typically determined by political decisions about the size of the state and
what it is aiming to achieve. Rather, InCiSE is designed to assess the
effectiveness of the way in which the civil service of a country uses the
inputs it has been given to deliver the policy outputs/ outcomes that it has
been set.

One of the main aims of the Index is to provide a mechanism for civil services
to learn from each other: in particular to offer a data-driven approach to
identify sources of good practice. To achieve this, InCiSE does not assess the
absolute performance of different civil services. Instead, it converts the
absolute performance captured in the individual metrics into relative
assessments of performance of the countries included in the Index. This means
that scoring poorly in InCiSE does not in itself indicate absolute poor
performance, rather that when compared to other countries performance is lower.
Similarly, scoring well in InCiSE does not in itself indicate absolute high
performance, but that when compared to other countries performance is higher.
The fact that there is no natural scale for civil service performance
strengthens the case for measuring relative rather than absolute performance.

## Eligibility of metrics {#sec-metric-eligibility}

Metrics are eligible for inclusion in InCiSE if they meet the following
criteria: 

* The data must be published in a free to-access form in the public domain
  and online. That is, an independent person must be able to access the data
  from a publicly accessible and free-to-use website.
* The data must be actionable. That is, the data must measure some quality or
  component of the civil service that government officials and ministers can
  act on to improve performance. Where data for the civil service is not
  available, public sector proxies can be used, but these must still be data
  that represent something that can be acted on.
* The data must be quantifiable, and if not directly collected and published as
  numerical data there must be a way to convert the data into a clear and
  relevant numerical format.

## Technical approach {#sec-technical-approach}

The technical approach for the 2019 model has used the 2017 InCiSE pilot
edition of the model as the reference point for its methodology however the
data collection and statistical model was rebuilt from first principles to
provide a "clean slate" for the 2019 modelling. That is the 2019 model did not
start as a copy of the 2017 final model with data updated to reflect the
latest values with new data inserted and code amended. Instead, the 2019 model
has been developed from scratch using [R](https://www.r-project.org) (rather
than the mix of Excel and Stata used for the 2017 Pilot). This approach has
been taken to (i) minimise the potential of error and improve quality assurance
processes, and (ii) improve the openness, reproducibility and extensibility of
the InCiSE model. The approach adopted for the 2019 InCiSE model is based on
the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines approach developed by data scientists at
the UK Government Digital Service [@gregory_rap_2017]. The technical
approach to coding and data management/processing was also influenced by the
"tidyverse" principles [@wickham_r_2017, @wickham_r_2015]. A full list of the
software packages used to develop and implement the modelling are listed in the
[References](references.qmd) section at the end of this report.

## Quality considerations and limitations {#sec-quality-limitations}

As with any analytical endeavour, there are limitations to how far and in what
ways the InCiSE Index can and can't be used. Furthermore, given its early stage
of development, the InCiSE Partners are clear that the index remains an
experimental methodology that is subject to change and evolve in order to
refine and improve the Index. 

This section outlines some of the key considerations that should be taken into
account when reviewing and using the InCiSE Index. Stating these limitations is
not to downplay the value of the index as a tool for cross-country comparison,
rather it is to help users understand the data they are using. Furthermore,
InCiSE is not intended to be used in isolation but to enhance the range of
evidence available about government effectiveness. Users should build a "rich
picture" of the situation by triangulation across the results from InCiSE, the
underlying results from InCiSE's source metrics or other international
comparisons, and domestic information for which there is no international
comparisons. 

There are a number of different aspects that should be taken into consideration
in regards to the quality of data used in InCiSE:

* *Recency and frequency of the data:* InCiSE 2019 uses the most recently
  available data as at 30 November 2018. Some metrics in InCiSE are collected
  annually, others biennial or longer, or are ad-hoc in their repetition. As a
  result, some metrics may use data that does not accurately reflect the most
  recent situation. 
* *Depth of the data:* Some metrics represent a single measure in a survey,
  some are aggregations of multiple measures by the InCiSE model, while some
  are composite indicators compiled by others parties that are based on a range
  of metrics. 
* *"Spill over":* Some measures that contribute to one of the InCiSE indicators
  may be relevant to other indicators, but wherever possible this has been
  avoided. No original piece of data used by the InCiSE model is used more than
  once in order to ensure that the overall figures are not overly-reliant on a
  particular data source. 
* *Public sector proxy:* The purpose of the InCiSE Index is to measure the
  effectiveness of a country's national and central civil service. However,
  some metrics measure the performance of the public sector at large – or at
  least a larger subset than the specific unit of analysis that InCiSE is
  interested in. In this case the public sector measures can only be
  considered proxies. 
* *Proxy measures of effectiveness:* The true nature of the effectiveness of a
  country's civil service is inherently unobservable, and cannot be
  comprehensively observed in an empirical study. The purpose of the InCiSE
  project is to provide a means to combine a range of proxy measures to provide
  insight into the effectiveness of civil services. The InCiSE framework
  enables this analysis by providing a way to conceptualise how a civil service
  operates. The model therefore uses measures about the functions and
  attributes of a civil service to produce an estimate of effectiveness.

## Relationship with other indicators and data collections {#sec-relationship}

In setting the civil service as our unit of interest, it is also important to
distinguish the difference of InCiSE with other ‘governance' indicators
(particularly the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators and the
Bertelsmann Foundation's Sustainable Governance Indicators). Other governance
indicators take a broad view of the topic of governance, including assessments
of political decision making within governing parties, the quality of
democracy, the ability to hold the government to account, and the freedoms of
media and civil society. These are important factors in considering the
governance of a country in general. InCiSE seeks to complement these ‘broad'
assessments of governance by providing a deeper investigation with a narrower
focus on a key element of the operation of government – the civil service.

Besides ‘broad' governance indicators there are also thematic indicators that
focus on specific elements of governance; for example, the World Wide Web
Foundation's Open Data Barometer, the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index
or the OECD's regulation indicators. There are also indicators focused on other
themes that cut across sectoral boundaries (for example Transparency
International's Global Corruption Barometer, or the World Economic Forum's
Doing Business Report) which contain a large amount of information about
countries but where only a few measures directly relate to central
government/civil service performance. 

Finally, there are also a range of data collections made by international
organisations and other institutions (notably the OECD, the European
Commission, and the United Nations) about the functioning of government/the
civil service but which do not produce single composite assessments. 

The InCiSE framework and index has been designed and developed to re-use data
from these indicators and data sources to produce a single coherent and
comparable data model that allows a wide variety of parties interested in civil
service reform to make a high-level assessment of how the civil services of
different countries compare. The InCiSE Index should not be used in isolation,
but in combination with reference to the source datasets as well as with
domestic data from within a country about performance across the various
indicators.

Further considerations about the specific data quality of the InCiSE data and
results is provided in @sec-index-methodology.
