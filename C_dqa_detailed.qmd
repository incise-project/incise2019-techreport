# Data quality assessment &ndash; detailed results {#sec-dqa-detailed}

::: {.callout-tip title="New content" icon="false"}
This content was not included in the original 2019 publication. It has been
included to provide more details on the results of the data quality assessment
that was used in the 2019 modelling.

@sec-index-methodology outlines the data quality assessment used in the
statistical modelling of the 2019 InCiSE Index including summaries of the
results as well as the use of the assessment results in country coverage
selection and indicator weighting. This appendix provides more detailed output
from the data quality assessment for all countries and territories included in
the original data sources.

As discussed in @sec-data-prep, each set of source data was matched against a
code list of 249 countries and territories produced by the "countrycode" package [@arel-bundock_countrycode_2018]. Of these entities, `r length(no_data)` have
no data, with the exception of the Holy See/Vatican City all of these are
overseas or dependent territories.

::: {.callout-note title="Geographic entities without data" icon="false" collapse="true"}

The following geographic entities had no entry in the any of the data sources
used by the InCiSE 2019 Index.

@sec-coverage summarises the data quality assessment results for the 200
countries and territories which had an entry in at least one of the data
sources used by the InCiSE 2019 Index. The table below shows for each
geographic entity the overall data quality assessment score, the percentage of
all metrics the entity has data for, and an icon summarising the data quality
for each of the 12 indicators measured in InCiSE 2019.

The data quality of each indicator is summarised as follows:

* A 'green' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator
  data quality score of 1 – the country has the best possible data available
  for this indicator.
* An 'amber' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator
  data quality score of greater than or equal to 0.5 – the country's data
  quality is at least half as good as the ‘best' possible data for that
  indicator.
* A ‘red' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator data
  quality score of less than 0.5 – the country's data quality is less than
  half as good as the 'best' possible data for that indicator.
* An ‘X' rating is given to those countries which have no data at all for that
  metric.

Note only the 38 countries with an overall data quality score of 0.5 or greater
were included in the 2019 InCiSE Index.
