publication\n\n[Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd) of this web book were presented as a\nsingle chapter (Chapter 3) in the original 2019 publication. For improved\nnavigation and readability this part of the report has been split into separate\nchapters. Footnotes have been added to charts, tables and chapters to indicate\nthe resulting differences in numbering between this web book and the original\nPDF publication.\n\n@sec-dqa-detailed was not included in the original 2019 publication. It\nhas been added to this web publication of the report to provide more details\nfor stakeholders on the results of the data quality assessment that was used in\nthe 2019 modelling.\n\n## List of figures\n\n:::{.custom-toc .list-of-figures}\n\n\n* @fig-framework: The InCiSE Index Framework\n* @fig-datamodel: The InCiSE data model\n* @fig-edu-levels: Tertiary education levels of adults 25-34 and 55-64, in selected\n* @fig-sens-results: Sensitivity analysis results\n\n\n:::\n\n## List of tables\n\n:::{.custom-toc .list-of-tables}\n\n\n* @tbl-scope: Scope of the InCiSE Framework\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-dqa-all: Data quality assessment (DQA) results across the 12 InCiSE indicators and overall, for all 249 countries and territories considered by the InCiSE data model\n* @tbl-dqa-incise: Data quality assessment (DQA) results for the 38 countries included in the 2019 index\n* @tbl-dqa-countries1: Data quality assessment (DQA) results by country\n* @tbl-dqa-countries2: Data quality assessment (DQA) results by country for the next countries after the 38 selected for inclusion in the InCiSE 2019 model\n* @tbl-ind-weights: InCiSE 2019 indicator weightings\n* @tbl-dqa-meta: Summary of data quality metadata for the 38 countries of the InCiSE 2019 Index\n* @tbl-rag-rating: Overall quality assessment 'RAG' rating of the 2019 InCiSE indicators\n* @tbl-dqa-grade: Data quality scores by indicator and country\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-int: Composition of the integrity indicator\n* @tbl-pemp-2017: Coding of post-employment cooling-off in the 2017 Pilot edition of InCiSE\n* @tbl-pemp-2019: Coding of post-employment cooling-off in the 2019 edition of InCiSE\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-opn: Composition of the openness indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-cap: Composition of the capabilities indicator countries\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-inc: Composition of the inclusiveness indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-pol: Composition of the policy making indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-ffm: Composition of the fiscal and financial management indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-reg: Composition of the regulation indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-crm: Composition of the crisis and risk management indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-pro: Composition of the procurement indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-hrm: Composition of the HR management indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-tax: Composition of the tax administration indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-comp-dig: Composition of the digital services indicator\n* @tbl-egbr-nat: Proportion of eGBR assessed services identified as 'national' level services\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-ref-year: Reference year of InCiSE metrics by indicator\n* @tbl-sens-summary-country: Variation in country ranking across sensitivity analyses\n* @tbl-sens-summary-group: Summary of variation in ranking changes across sensitivity analysis sets\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-indicator-future: Potential future improvement of indicators measured in the 2019 edition of InCiSE\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-composite-int: Composite metrics in the integrity indicator\n* @tbl-composite-inc: Composite metrics in the inclusiveness indicator\n* @tbl-composite-ffm: Composite metrics in the fiscal and financial management indicator\n* @tbl-composite-tax: Composite metrics in the tax administration indicator\n* @tbl-composite-pro: Composite metrics in the procurement indicator\n* @tbl-composite-crm: Composite metrics in the crisis and risk management indicator\n\n******\n\n* @tbl-sens-country: Sensitivity tests varying country coverage\n* @tbl-sens-date: Sensitivity tests varying reference year\n* @tbl-sens-weight: Sensitivity tests with alternative approaches to weighting\n* @tbl-sens-base: Sensitivity tests adjusting the base data\n* @tbl-sens-impute: Sensitivity tests adjusting the base data\n\n\n:::\n",
