It provides an explanation\nof the high-level principles underlying the development of the InCiSE Index,\nthe overarching methodology for the Index's calculation, the methodology for\neach of the constituent indicators that make up the Index, and documents the\nmethodological changes made following the 2017 Pilot edition of the index. \n\n## Why InCiSE is needed {#sec-why-needed}\nAn effective civil service can play a vital role in determining a country's\nprogress and prosperity. But what constitutes an \"effective civil service\"?\nThe functions of the central government are not always directly comparable to\nother organisations in a given country. Thus, international comparisons of\ngovernment and civil service activity are often sought. \n\nInCiSE aims to define \"effectiveness\" more extensively than previous literature,\ndrawing on a wide range of existing international data sources to bring together\na set of indicators, each measuring a different dimension of civil service\neffectiveness. These indicators are then used to produce a composite (overall)\nscore. This creation of a new and concise set of civil service effectiveness\nindicators therefore serves as: \n\n* An accountability tool: allowing citizens, government officials, and\n  politicians to establish clearly and concisely how well their civil service\n  is performing. \n* A performance improvement tool: enabling senior decision makers to see\n  the countries which perform best in each area, and therefore learn from them. \n\nInCiSE has been developed following a literature review and in consultation\nwith many experts, including academics from schools of government, think-tanks\nthat monitor government effectiveness, international organisations, senior\ncivil servants (past and present) and subject matter experts. InCiSE has also\nbeen the subject of an independent, international peer review process. The 2019\nedition of InCiSE has also benefited from the feedback collected and provided\nsince the publication of the 2017 Pilot. \n\n## Defining the civil service {#sec-define-civil-service}\n\nCivil service effectiveness is well recognised in academic, international and\npractitioner communities as a highly complex area for analysis. As well as data\nlimitations and the need to take account of country context factors, analysts\nare also faced with differing views on the definitions of both \"civil service\"\nand \"effectiveness\". The scope, responsibilities, and structure of the civil\nservice vary across countries, creating the need to establish exactly what is\nbeing assessed, and how. In defining the civil service there are a number of\npossible approaches to take: \n\n* First, a civil service can be defined by function: a narrow view of the civil\n  service through this definition focuses on the central, \"upstream\" agencies\n  which set policy direction and procedural regulation for \"downstream\"\n  agencies. The broader view encompasses agencies responsible for service\n  delivery. \n* Second, a civil service can be defined by national accounts: this perspective\n  sees the civil service as made up of entities which are owned by the\n  government, and whose financial reporting places them within the System of\n  National Accounts (SNA) category of General Government.\n* Third, a civil service can be defined by employment regimes: under this\n  definition, civil service entities are limited to those which are required to\n  hire most employees under the civil service law, and those using other legal\n  employment regimes are excluded. \n\nHowever, conceptual and practical problems arise under each of these\ndefinitions. For example, staff commonly referred to as \"civil servants\" do not\nalways have legally distinct employee contracts; the SNA definition is\ninconsistent with the views of many practitioners and researchers; and each\nalternative conception results in a large and unwieldy group of agencies. \n\nInCiSE therefore takes a fourth and alternative approach, defining the scope of\n‘civil services' by outlining and measuring performance on the core functions\nof civil services; the parts which can generally be classified as civil service\nin every country. This approach leads to a focus on (i) functions which deliver\nservices or affect citizens directly and (ii) public management and policy\nfunctions carried out in the centre of government.\n\nThe unit of analysis of interest for the InCiSE Index is the civil service,\nrather than the public sector more generally. InCiSE also focuses on civil\nservice at the central/federal level – the highest level of government in a\ncountry/state – rather than at the regional or local level. Even with these\nparameters, isolating civil service performance with currently available data\nis still difficult, particularly given the varying sizes and shapes of civil\nservices internationally. \n\n@tbl-scope gives more detail about what is included and excluded in the InCiSE\nIndex. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-scope .cell tbl-cap='Scope of the InCiSE Framework'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"table\">\n  <thead>\n    \n    <tr class=\"gt_col_headings\">\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"Part/function of the public sector\">Part/function of the public sector</th>\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"Degree of inclusion in the InCiSE framework\">Degree of inclusion in the InCiSE framework</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody class=\"gt_table_body\">\n    <tr><td headers=\"part_function\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Civil service functions that deliver services to citizens and organisations directly (e.g. tax and social security administration at the central/ federal level).</td>\n<td headers=\"degree_of_inclusion\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">A primary focus of the InCiSE framework</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"part_function\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Public administration functions of central government (e.g. fiscal management, policy making, regulation)</td>\n<td headers=\"degree_of_inclusion\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">A primary focus of the InCiSE framework</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"part_function\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">'Mission support' functions (e.g. HRM and procurement) that support the operation of central government organisations.</td>\n<td headers=\"degree_of_inclusion\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">A primary focus of the InCiSE framework</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"part_function\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Parts of the civil service which direct and support the wider public sector on specific policy areas (e.g. ministries of health or education) but may not deliver services to citizens directly.</td>\n<td headers=\"degree_of_inclusion\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Performance captured through the assessment of central government's public administration functions (e.g. policy making, regulation).

Whilst there are many\nalternative ways to define civil service effectiveness, the framework outlined\nhere is informed by evidence and set out in such a way that if a civil service\nscores highly against it, it is reasonable to conclude that this civil service\nis high-performing relative to its international counterparts. \n\nOur approach to deriving a common framework was to:\n\n* Specify and adhere to a set of principles to inform the development of the\n  framework:\n    * Coherent – identifying the key elements and drivers of effective public\n      administration\n    * Comprehensive – covering all relevant aspects and drivers of the\n      performance of public administration\n    * Actionable – offering genuine insights into what drives excellent public\n      administration that can be implemented\n    * Transparent – a clear methodology and assessment process to ensure\n      credibility, robustness, and replicability\n    * Feasible – it is possible to collect data for a large group of countries\n      at reasonable cost\n* Draw on evidence to identify key features of a draft\n  framework which was then extensively tested through consultation. \n* Build on existing indicators and data where possible, striving to develop\n  a more comprehensive framework capturing all aspects of civil service\n  effectiveness.\n* Refine the framework through consultation with a number of experts,\n  including academics, think-tanks, international organisations,\n  civil servants (both past and present) and subject experts. \n\nA common approach for assessing organisational effectiveness is to think in\nterms of inputs, outputs, and outcomes. However, this is appears less\nattractive when considering civil services and the public administration-type\nfunctions they provide. While output and outcome measures may have the\nadvantage of cutting through conceptual uncertainty, they can be problematic\nin this area for three reasons: \n\n1.  Outputs and outcomes can be affected by external factors, making it\n    difficult to isolate the contribution of the civil service. \n2.  Measuring outputs and their value can be methodologically problematic,\n    particularly as many public sector outputs are provided free at the point\n    of consumption.\n3.  Focusing on outputs and outcomes means that normative and procedural\n    concerns which are also relevant to effectiveness can be ignored. \n\nGiven these concerns, the preferred approach here is to focus on the\neffectiveness of the procedures within the civil service which (often\nindirectly) affect outcomes. The framework's approach is therefore more process\nfocused and output focused, as outlined in @fig-framework. An advantage of\nchoosing process-based indicators is that they are more instructive for\npotential performance improvements – it is processes that are ultimately\nchanged to increase effectiveness. \n\nAlthough procedural definitions also come with problems (they may not actually\ncorrelate with positive outcomes, for example) certain procedural measures\nremain at the core of any measure of effectiveness. Where there is evidence to\nsupport the relationship between procedures and positive outcomes, procedures\nmay also be intrinsically beneficial. For example, meritocracy of recruitment\nprocedures in the civil service are important because there is broad agreement\nthat such procedures and outcomes are associated with an effective civil\nservice. However, the extent to which recruitment processes reward merit is\nalso important in the principle of fairness which is valued in itself. \n\n![The InCiSE Index Framework](figures/incise_framework.png){#fig-framework}\n\nThe InCiSE framework, shown in @fig-framework, defines the core characteristics\nof an effective civil service. To do this, it assesses effectiveness on the\nbasis of two interrelated dimensions: 1) the delivery of its core functions and\n2) an underlying set of attributes which are important drivers of effectiveness\nacross all parts of the civil service. Collectively the functions and\nattributes are called ‘indicators' within the InCiSE model.\n@sec-technical-approach describes in more detail how the framework is\nimplemented as a statistical\nmodel. \n\n**Functions**: On one side, civil services deliver a set of central executive\nfunctions for ministers. These may help to formulate policy for the country\n(the effects of which are borne by citizens). On the other side, the services\ninteract more directly with citizens through the delivery of services such as\ntax administration. Finally, in the centre, supporting these core external\nfunctions, are mission support functions such as HR management or IT services\nfor officials. By looking across all three types of function, the aim is to\nmeasure how well civil services deliver the core elements of their roles. The\nfunctions identified by the InCiSE model are: \n\n* *Policy making:* The quality of the policy making process, including how\n  policy is developed and coordinated across government and monitored during\n  implementation.\n* *Fiscal and financial management:* The quality of the budgeting process and\n  the extent to which spending decisions are informed through economic\n  appraisal and evaluation. \n* *Regulation:* The extent and quality of regulatory impact assessments and\n  the degree of stakeholder engagement involved in them.\n* *Crisis and risk management:* The effectiveness with which the government\n  engages the whole of society to better assess, prevent, respond to and\n  recover from the effects of extreme events.\n* *Procurement:* The extent to which the procurement process is efficient,\n  competitive, fair, and pursues value for money.\n* *HR management:* The meritocracy of recruitment and the extent to which civil\n  servants are effectively attracted, managed and developed.\n* *IT for officials:* The extent to which civil servants have the technology and\n  digital tools to work efficiently.\n* *Internal finance:* The extent to which civil service operations are supported\n  by well-managed and efficient finance systems, particularly on the alignment\n  of finance with the business strategy and the level of civil servant\n  satisfaction with finance support.\n* *Tax administration:* The efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection\n  (at the central/federal level).\n  Social security administration: The efficiency and effectiveness of\n  social security administration (at the central/federal level). \n* *Digital services:* The availability and usability of national-level digital\n  public services. \n\n**Attributes:** Every civil service also has an underlying set of attributes\nwhich are important drivers of how effectively they deliver core functions.\nThese attributes should apply to all parts of the civil service and are not\nspecific to particular parts or functions. The inclusion of attributes in the\nframework is based on both a normative and a positive judgement: civil\nservices should aim to cultivate and demonstrate these attributes as they are\ncommonly (but not necessarily universally) understood as aspects of best\npractice, and the included attributes should generally be determinants of\nperformance across all functions. \n\n* *Integrity:* The extent to which civil servants behave with integrity, make\n  decisions impartially and fairly, and strive to serve both citizens and ministers. \n* *Openness:* The regular practice and degree of consultation with citizens to\n  help guide the decisions we make and extent of transparency in our\n  decision-making. \n* *Capabilities:* The extent to which the workforce has the right mix of skills.\n* *Inclusiveness:* The extent to which the civil service is representative of\n  the citizens it serves. \n* *Staff engagement:* Staff levels of pride, attachment and motivation to work\n  for their organisation.\n* *Innovation:* The degree to which new ideas, policies, and ways of operating\n  are able to freely develop. \n\nThe 2019 edition of InCiSE measures 12 of the 17 functions and attributes\ndefined by the framework. [Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd) provides\nfurther detail of the definition and measurement of each of these indicators.\nFour of the five indicators (IT for officials, internal finance, staff\nengagement, and innovation) are not included because it has not been possible\nto identify suitable or sufficient data for cross-country measurement. One of\nthe five indicators (social security administration) was measured in the 2017\nPilot but has been depreciated due to data quality concerns.\n\n## The InCiSE data model {#sec-incise-datamodel}\n\nThe InCiSE Index is based on a framework that describes the various components\nof an effective civil service. The Index operationalises this framework by\nmeasuring a series of indicators that correspond to the different components of\nthe InCiSE framework. The overall InCiSE Index results are a composite of the\nindicator scores. In turn the indicators are split into themes, which describe\nimportant sub-divisions of the indicator. Scores for these themes are not\ncomputed but the theme structure is part of the weighting used in the\ncalculation of the indicator scores. The themes within an indicator are\nrepresented by individual metrics, which ideally measure tangible qualities of\nthe civil service that can be acted upon or influenced by senior officials.\nMost of the InCiSE metrics are single data points published by the data source\nproviders, however some metrics are calculated from multiple data points.\n@fig-datamodel outlines the \"data model\" used by InCiSE, showing how individual\ndata points from the external data sources combine to form the metrics,\nindicators and composite index of InCiSE.\n\nInCiSE is not intended to measure inputs (e.g. money/resources) or public policy\noutputs (e.g. unemployment benefits paid; taxes collected) or citizen outcomes\n(e.g. life expectancy, GDP per capita, citizen wellbeing), as these are\ntypically determined by political decisions about the size of the state and\nwhat it is aiming to achieve. Rather, InCiSE is designed to assess the\neffectiveness of the way in which the civil service of a country uses the\ninputs it has been given to deliver the policy outputs/ outcomes that it has\nbeen set.\n\nOne of the main aims of the Index is to provide a mechanism for civil services\nto learn from each other: in particular to offer a data-driven approach to\nidentify sources of good practice. To achieve this, InCiSE does not assess the\nabsolute performance of different civil services. Instead, it converts the\nabsolute performance captured in the individual metrics into relative\nassessments of performance of the countries included in the Index. This means\nthat scoring poorly in InCiSE does not in itself indicate absolute poor\nperformance, rather that when compared to other countries performance is lower.\nSimilarly, scoring well in InCiSE does not in itself indicate absolute high\nperformance, but that when compared to other countries performance is higher.\nThe fact that there is no natural scale for civil service performance\nstrengthens the case for measuring relative rather than absolute performance. \n\n![The InCiSE data model](figures/incise_datamodel.png){#fig-datamodel}\n\n## Eligibility of metrics {#sec-metric-eligibility}\n\nMetrics are eligible for inclusion in InCiSE if they meet the following\ncriteria: \n\n* The data must be published in a free to-access form in the public domain\n  and online. That is, an independent person must be able to access the data\n  from a publicly accessible and free-to-use website.\n* The data must be actionable. That is, the data must measure some quality or\n  component of the civil service that government officials and ministers can\n  act on to improve performance. Where data for the civil service is not\n  available, public sector proxies can be used, but these must still be data\n  that represent something that can be acted on.\n* The data must be quantifiable, and if not directly collected and published as\n  numerical data there must be a way to convert the data into a clear and\n  relevant numerical format.\n\n## Technical approach {#sec-technical-approach}\n\nThe technical approach for the 2019 model has used the 2017 InCiSE pilot\nedition of the model as the reference point for its methodology however the\ndata collection and statistical model was rebuilt from first principles to\nprovide a \"clean slate\" for the 2019 modelling. That is the 2019 model did not\nstart as a copy of the 2017 final model with data updated to reflect the\nlatest values with new data inserted and code amended. Instead, the 2019 model\nhas been developed from scratch using [R](https://www.r-project.org) (rather\nthan the mix of Excel and Stata used for the 2017 Pilot). This approach has\nbeen taken to (i) minimise the potential of error and improve quality assurance\nprocesses, and (ii) improve the openness, reproducibility and extensibility of\nthe InCiSE model. The approach adopted for the 2019 InCiSE model is based on\nthe Reproducible Analytical Pipelines approach developed by data scientists at\nthe UK Government Digital Service [@gregory_rap_2017]. The technical\napproach to coding and data management/processing was also influenced by the\n\"tidyverse\" principles [@wickham_r_2017, @wickham_r_2015]. A full list of the\nsoftware packages used to develop and implement the modelling are listed in the\n[References](99_references.qmd) section at the end of this report.\n\n## Quality considerations and limitations {#sec-quality-limitations}\n\nAs with any analytical endeavour, there are limitations to how far and in what\nways the InCiSE Index can and can't be used. Furthermore, given its early stage\nof development, the InCiSE Partners are clear that the index remains an\nexperimental methodology that is subject to change and evolve in order to\nrefine and improve the Index. \n\nThis section outlines some of the key considerations that should be taken into\naccount when reviewing and using the InCiSE Index. Stating these limitations is\nnot to downplay the value of the index as a tool for cross-country comparison,\nrather it is to help users understand the data they are using. Furthermore,\nInCiSE is not intended to be used in isolation but to enhance the range of\nevidence available about government effectiveness. Users should build a \"rich\npicture\" of the situation by triangulation across the results from InCiSE, the\nunderlying results from InCiSE's source metrics or other international\ncomparisons, and domestic information for which there is no international\ncomparisons. \n\nThere are a number of different aspects that should be taken into consideration\nin regards to the quality of data used in InCiSE:\n\n* *Recency and frequency of the data:* InCiSE 2019 uses the most recently\n  available data as at 30 November 2018. Some metrics in InCiSE are collected\n  annually, others biennial or longer, or are ad-hoc in their repetition. As a\n  result, some metrics may use data that does not accurately reflect the most\n  recent situation. \n* *Depth of the data:* Some metrics represent a single measure in a survey,\n  some are aggregations of multiple measures by the InCiSE model, while some\n  are composite indicators compiled by others parties that are based on a range\n  of metrics. \n* *\"Spill over\":* Some measures that contribute to one of the InCiSE indicators\n  may be relevant to other indicators, but wherever possible this has been\n  avoided. No original piece of data used by the InCiSE model is used more than\n  once in order to ensure that the overall figures are not overly-reliant on a\n  particular data source. \n* *Public sector proxy:* The purpose of the InCiSE Index is to measure the\n  effectiveness of a country's national and central civil service. However,\n  some metrics measure the performance of the public sector at large – or at\n  least a larger subset than the specific unit of analysis that InCiSE is\n  interested in. In this case the public sector measures can only be\n  considered proxies. \n* *Proxy measures of effectiveness:* The true nature of the effectiveness of a\n  country's civil service is inherently unobservable, and cannot be\n  comprehensively observed in an empirical study. The purpose of the InCiSE\n  project is to provide a means to combine a range of proxy measures to provide\n  insight into the effectiveness of civil services. The InCiSE framework\n  enables this analysis by providing a way to conceptualise how a civil service\n  operates. The model therefore uses measures about the functions and\n  attributes of a civil service to produce an estimate of effectiveness.\n\n## Relationship with other indicators and data collections {#sec-relationship}\n\nIn setting the civil service as our unit of interest, it is also important to\ndistinguish the difference of InCiSE with other ‘governance' indicators\n(particularly the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators and the\nBertelsmann Foundation's Sustainable Governance Indicators). Other governance\nindicators take a broad view of the topic of governance, including assessments\nof political decision making within governing parties, the quality of\ndemocracy, the ability to hold the government to account, and the freedoms of\nmedia and civil society. These are important factors in considering the\ngovernance of a country in general. InCiSE seeks to complement these ‘broad'\nassessments of governance by providing a deeper investigation with a narrower\nfocus on a key element of the operation of government – the civil service.\n\nBesides ‘broad' governance indicators there are also thematic indicators that\nfocus on specific elements of governance; for example, the World Wide Web\nFoundation's Open Data Barometer, the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index\nor the OECD's regulation indicators. There are also indicators focused on other\nthemes that cut across sectoral boundaries (for example Transparency\nInternational's Global Corruption Barometer, or the World Economic Forum's\nDoing Business Report) which contain a large amount of information about\ncountries but where only a few measures directly relate to central\ngovernment/civil service performance. \n\nFinally, there are also a range of data collections made by international\norganisations and other institutions (notably the OECD, the European\nCommission, and the United Nations) about the functioning of government/the\ncivil service but which do not produce single composite assessments. \n\nThe InCiSE framework and index has been designed and developed to re-use data\nfrom these indicators and data sources to produce a single coherent and\ncomparable data model that allows a wide variety of parties interested in civil\nservice reform to make a high-level assessment of how the civil services of\ndifferent countries compare. The InCiSE Index should not be used in isolation,\nbut in combination with reference to the source datasets as well as with\ndomestic data from within a country about performance across the various\nindicators.\n\nFurther considerations about the specific data quality of the InCiSE data and\nresults is provided in [Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd).\n\n## Structure of this report {#sec-report-structure}\n\nThis Technical Report on the InCiSE Index is intended to describe the\nmethodology, data and limitations of the approach used. The results of the\nIndex can be found in the accompanying 2019 Results Report. Including the\nintroductory chapter, there are seven chapters in this report: \n\n* *Chapter 2: Methodology* of the InCiSE Index outlines the data processing,\n  calculation of the InCiSE indicators, and calculation of the InCiSE Index.\n* *Chapter 3: Methodology of the InCiSE* indicators sets out the methodology\n  for each of the 12 indicators that make up the 2019 index.\n* *Chapter 4: Summary of changes* from the 2017 Pilot highlights the changes\n  made within the methodology of each indicator, as well as in the overarching\n  methodology of the index.\n* *Chapter 5: Sensitivity analysis* describes some of the uncertainties\n  associated with the modelling process and subjective choices, and the\n  consequent impact on the Index results. \n* *Chapter 6: Future development* sets out the next steps for future\n  consideration and development of the index methodology.\n\nThere are also two annexes to the report that provide additional detail:\n\n* *Annex A: Composite metrics* provides details of how the different composite\n  metrics used in the InCiSE Index have been constructed. \n* *Annex B: Sensitivity analysis* results provides detailed results of the\n  different tests conducted as part of the sensitivity analysis.\n\n",
