The overall Index is the normalised and weighted average of the scores\nof the constituent InCiSE indicators. The InCiSE indicators are themselves\nnormalised weighted averages of their individual metrics. The calculation and\nmodelling process to produce the Index is as follows:\n\n1. Data processing:\n    a. Data preparation [@sec-data-prep]\n    b. Data quality assessment [@sec-data-quality]\n    c. Country coverage selection [@sec-coverage]\n    d. Imputation of missing data [@sec-imputation]\n    e. Data normalisation [@sec-normalisation]\n2. Calculation of the InCiSE indicators [@sec-calc-indicators]:\n    a. Raw score calculated as a weighted average of the individual metrics\n    b. Raw score normalised to produce final indicator score\n3. Calculation of the InCiSE Index [@sec-calc-index]:\n    a. Raw score calculated as a weighted average of the indicator scores\n    b. Raw score normalised to produce final Index score\n\nThis chapter outlines the methodology for each of these different stages, and\nfinishes with a discussion of key data quality considerations\nin [@sec-considerations] and comparisons over time in [@sec-time-series], while\n[Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd) provide details on the specific methodology\nof each of the InCiSE indicators.\n\n## Data preparation {#sec-data-prep}\n\nThe data for InCiSE comes from a wide range of independent sources, such as the\nUN's E-Government Survey, Transparency International's Global Corruption\nBarometer, and Bertelsmann's Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGIs).[^data]\nThe InCiSE partnership does not produce any of the source data itself or engage\nin primary data collection.\n\n[^data]: A full list of data sources can be found in the\n[References](99_references.qmd) section at the end of this report.\n\nThe data for the 2019 edition of InCiSE is the latest available as of 30\nNovember 2018. As well as the source metrics some additional data are collected\nto aid in the imputation of missing data – this data does not directly\ncontribute to the scores and therefore is not included in the published results.\n\nSome of the source data requires processing before it is suitable for use in\nthe InCiSE calculations and modelling. For example:\n\n* *Binary/multiple categorical data:* some of the source data are binary\n  measures (e.g. yes/no questions) or assess multiple categories (e.g. groups\n  subject to whistleblower protection). In most cases this type of data is\n  summed.\n\n* *Individual level microdata:* InCiSE uses a custom analysis of the Programme\n  for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)\n  individual-level microdata to produce country scores. The Opentender data on\n  procurement is on individual contracts, which also requires analysis to\n  produce country scores.\n \n* *Negatively framed data:* Some of the source data is based on negatively\n  framed questions, where a higher score is poorer performance than a lower\n  score. To align with other metrics, this data is inverted so that higher\n  scores relate to better performance than lower scores.\n\n* *Calculations against reference data:* For the inclusiveness indicator,\n  women's representation in the civil service/public sector is compared to the\n  labour market in general. Tax administration from the OECD is published as\n  raw data. InCiSE uses rates based on these data which must therefore be\n  calculated.\n\n[Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd) outline the underlying source data for each\nof the indicators, and covers the specific transformations that are applied to\nthe source data. @sec-composite-metrics outlines the construction and\ncalculation of the composite metrics (metrics calculated from more than a\nsingle data point in the original source) that are included in some of the\nindicators.\n\nWhen importing data to the InCiSE model, data is matched against a reference\nlist of 249 countries and territories produced by\n@arel-bundock_countrycode_2018 using the 3-digit ISO 3166-1 alphanumeric codes.\nSome source data natively uses the 3-digit ISO country codes, but some use the\n2-digit ISO code, another code system, or a name of the territory (either the\nofficial long/short name, or colloquial name). Therefore, as part of data\npreparation, all country references are converted to the 3-digit ISO country\ncode.\n\n## Data quality assessment {#sec-data-quality}\n\nIn order to provide a clearer understanding of the quality of the InCiSE Index,\na data quality assessment has been calculated and published alongside the\n2019 edition. This assessment has a dual role: it is an important piece of\nmetadata that will help users of the InCiSE Index better understand the\nresults, but it has also been used to determine the country coverage of the\nInCiSE Index. This section describes the method for conducting the data quality\nassessment. The use of the assessment for country selection and weighting are\ndiscussed in sections @sec-coverage and @sec-calc-index respectively, while a\nwider discussion of data quality based on the results of the assessment is\nprovided at section @sec-considerations.\n\nThe data quality assessment is a purely quantitative exercise based on three\nfactors: data availability, the (non-)use of public sector proxy data, and\nthe recency of the data. The assessment does not include any subjective\nevaluation of the methodology or the quality of the data sources that the\nunderlying data used by InCiSE comes from.\n\nThe data quality assessment also does not incorporate assessments of the\nreliability or validity of indicator and index construction. Its purpose is to\nprovide an assessment of easily quantifiable characteristics of the data,\nwhich can help interpretation of the InCiSE results for countries and of\nthe indicators.\n\nThe simple mean of the three measures is taken as the data quality score for\neach country for each indicator. The 12 overall indicator quality scores are\nthen combined as a simple mean score to produce an overall data quality\nassessment for each country.\n\nFor each indicator, the data quality assessment is based on three measures:\n(1) the proportion of metrics with data; (2) the proportion of metrics that\nhave civil service specific data; and (3) the recency of the data. All three\nmeasures take a simple assessment of whether data is missing or present as\ntheir basis. However, each measure has different weighting rules for the data:\n\n* *Data availability:* A missing data point fora metric with a\n  within-indicator weight of 15% will give a greater penalty than a missing data\n  point for a metric with a within-indicator weight of 5%.\n* *Civil service data (1) or a public sector proxy (0):* Data points that come\n  from public sector data are treated as equivalent to being missing.\n* *Recency of the data:* The reference year of the metric is scaled from 0\n  (for 2012, the earliest year) to 1 (for 2018, the latest year) and used as\n  the weighting.[^recency]\n\n[^recency]: For example a datapoint with a reference year of 2013 will be\nweighted 0.1667, while one with a reference year of 2016 will be weighted\n0.6667.\n\nThe country indicator data quality scores and overall data quality assessment\n($DQA_{c,i}$) for a given country ($c$) and indicator ($i$) is calculated by\nmultiplying the missing data matrix of the metrics in the indicator for that\ncountry ($d_{c,i}$) by each of: the within indicator weighting for the metrics\nin the indicator ($m_i$), the proxy data status of each metric in the indicator\n($s_i$), and the recency of each metric in the indicator ($r_i$). The resulting\nproducts are summed and divided by three to give the mean data quality for that\ncountry and indicator.\n\n$$\nDQA_{c,i} = \\frac{{(d_{c,i} * m_i) + (d_{c,i} * s_i) + (d_{c,i} * r_i)}}{3}\n$$\n\nThe overall data quality indicator for a country ($DQA_c$) is then calculated\nas the sum of data quality assessment scores of that country for each indicator\ndivided by the number of indicators ($n_i$).\n\n$$\nDQA_c = \\frac{\\sum{DQA_{c,i}}}{n_i}\n$$\n\nThe data quality assessment scores therefore have a theoretical range from 0\nto 1. Where 0 represents there being no metrics available and 1 represents\nthere being data for all metrics, with all data representing the civil service\n(i.e. not using a public-sector proxy) and all data relating to the latest\navailable year. @tbl-dqa-all illustrates the complex picture of\ndata quality across all countries and indicators.\n\nThe table shows how maximum data quality varies from 0.333 for capabilities,\nwhere the available data is for a public sector proxy and the oldest data in\nthe model, to 1.000 for policy making, where all the available data relates to\nthe civil service and is at the latest available data.\n\nThe indicators for openness, fiscal & financial management and crisis & risk\nmanagement have good data quality (DQA score greater than or equal to 0.5) for\na very large number of countries. Other indicators (such as HR management or\ntax administration) have a moderate number of countries with good data quality,\nbut have a large number of countries with poorer data quality. Finally, some\nindicators (such as digital services or policy making) have data for only a\nsmall number of countries, which is typically due to the source data covering\nonly OECD or EU members (or both).\n\n\n::: {#tbl-dqa-all .cell tbl-cap='Data quality assessment (DQA) results across the 12 InCiSE indicators and overall, for all 249 countries and territories considered by the InCiSE data model'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"table\">\n  <thead>\n    \n    <tr class=\"gt_col_headings gt_spanner_row\">\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_left\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"Indicator\">Indicator</th>\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_center\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"Highest country DQA score\">Highest country DQA score</th>\n      <th class=\"gt_center gt_columns_top_border gt_column_spanner_outer\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" scope=\"colgroup\" id=\"Distribution of country DQA scores\">\n        <span class=\"gt_column_spanner\">Distribution of country DQA scores</span>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_col_headings\">\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_center\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"DQA ≥ 0.5\">DQA ≥ 0.5</th>\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_center\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"0.5 &amp;gt;

The data quality assessment outlined in\n@sec-data-quality provides a more nuanced way to consider the variation of data\navailability and quality, and is therefore used to determine which countries\nare included in the final version of the index for the InCiSE 2019.\n\nIn determining country coverage, the InCiSE Partners have decided to use an\noverall data quality assessment score of 0.5 or greater for the threshold for\ncountry inclusion. 38 countries reached this score. Although two further\ncountries would be included if data quality scores were rounded to 1 decimal\nplace, these two countries have lower data availability (57% and 51% of all\nmetrics respectively), which is judged to be too low for reliable analysis.\nTherefore, the 38 countries with a data quality score of 0.5 or higher\n(when rounded to 2-decimal places) are included in the 2019 edition of the\nInCiSE Index. This includes all 31 countries covered by the InCiSE pilot.\n\n@tbl-dqa-incise provides an overview of the country-level data quality scores\nfor the group of 38 countries. The table shows that for most indicators the 38\ncountries have generally good data quality. However, for four indicators\n(capabilities, crisis & risk management, digital services and procurement)\nthere are a small number of countries with no available data at all.\n\n@tbl-dqa-countries1 provides a summary of the data quality assessment for all\n38 countries selected for the 2019 edition of InCiSE, @tbl-dqa-countries2\nprovides the assessment for the five countries with the next highest data\nquality score. One country (the United Kingdom) achieved the highest overall\ndata quality score of 0.757, followed closely by five others (Italy, Poland,\nSweden, Norway and Slovenia). Countries included for the first time in the\n2019 edition of the Index are flagged with the \"[new]\" marker next to their\ncountry name in @tbl-dqa-countries1.\n\nFurther discussion on data quality issues are provided at the end of this\nchapter in section @sec-considerations, covering both the quality of the\nindicators and interpretation of country level results from the InCiSE Index.\n\n\n:::

(i.e.\n100% of metrics). The average level of data availability is 86% across the 38\ncountries, and 7 of the included countries have data availability below the\n75% threshold used for the 2017 Pilot, with the lowest level of data\navailability being 65%. Of the 38 countries, 15 have one indicator with a data\nquality score of 0 (i.e. no data at all for that indicator), two countries have\ntwo indicators with a data quality score of 0 and one country has three\nindicators with a data quality score of 0.\n\nThis presents issues for the analysis of the data and providing an effective\nmethod for aggregating the metrics into indicators and an overall index.\nThe 2017 Pilot edition of InCiSE adopted two methods for imputation: multiple\nimputation using linear regression and median imputation. For the 2019 edition\nof InCiSE a decision has been made to move fully to a multiple imputation\napproach, using the 'predictive mean matching' (PMM) technique of\n@van_buuren_mice_2011. The PMM technique uses correlation – of both the values\nand pattern of missing data – to identify for a country with missing data those\ncountries in the dataset that closely match it, and randomly select one of\nthose to replace the missing value. Following the approach set out by\n@van_buuren_flexible_2018, for each missing value 15 imputations are generated\n(each of which has also been iterated 15 times). A simple mean of these 15\nimputation values is then calculated and used as the country's value in the\n'final' dataset.\n\nImputation is handled on a per-indicator basis – in most cases imputation will\nbe solely from within the metrics of that indicator. However, a few indicators\nhave external predictors, either data from elsewhere in the InCiSE model or\nfrom an external data source. Full details of the imputation approach for each\nindicator are described in [Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd).\n\n## Data normalisation {#sec-normalisation}\n\nAs a result of coming from different sources, the underlying data that drives\nthe InCiSE model has a variety of formats: some are proportions or scores from\n0 to 1 or 0 to 100; some are ratings on a scale, or the average of ratings\ngiven by a set of assessors/survey participants; and some are counts. The\ndifferent formats of these data are not easily comparable, and cannot be\ndirectly averaged together to produce a combined score. In order to facilitate\nthe comparison and combination of data from different sources, the metrics are\nnormalised so that they are all in a common format.\n\nThere are a number of normalisation techniques that could be used. A useful\ndiscussion of the different methods is provided in the @oecd_handbook_2008\nHandbook on Constructing Composite Indicators. The InCiSE Index uses min-max\nnormalisation at all stages, as this maintains the underlying distribution of\neach metric while providing a common scale of 0 to 1. The common scale is of\nparticular benefit, as it helps achieve InCiSE's goal of assessing relative\nperformance. In the min-max normalisation 0 represents the lowest achieved\nscore and 1 represents the highest achieved score. It is therefore important\nto note that scoring 0 on a particular metric, indicator or the index itself\ndoes not represent poor performance in absolute terms, nor does scoring 1\nrepresent high performance in absolute terms. Rather the country is either the\nlowest or highest performing of the 38 countries selected.\n\nThe min-max normalisation operates via the following mathematical formula:\n\n$$\nm_c = \\frac{x_c-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}\n$$\n\nFor a metric for a given country its normalised score ($m_c$) is calculated as\nthe difference of the country's original score ($x_c$) from the metric's\nminimum score ($x_min$) divided by the range of the metric's scores (the\ndifference of the metric's maximum score ($x_max$) from the metric's minimum\nscore ($x_min$).\n\n## Calculation of the InCiSE indicators {#sec-calc-indicators}\n\nOnce the data has been processed, missing data imputed, and the metrics\nnormalised, the InCiSE indicators can be calculated. There are two stages to\nthe calculation of the indicators: the weighting of the metrics into an\naggregate score, and the normalisation of that score.\n\nAs outlined in @fig-datamodel, the InCiSE data model first groups metrics into\nthemes before aggregating into the indicator scores themselves. These themes\nare purely structural and scores for them are not computed. The raw score for\nan indicator follows this formula:\n\n$$\ni_c = \\sum{(m_{i,c}*w_m*w_t)}\n$$\n\nA country's raw score for an indicator ($i_c$) is calculated as the sum of the\nproduct of each metric within the indicator for that country ($m_{i,c}$) with\nthe weight of that metric within its theme ($w_m$) and the weight of that\ntheme within the indicator ($w_t$). The weighting structure for each indicator\nare listed in detail in [Chapters 3-14](03_00_indicators.qmd). After the raw scores\nare calculated they are normalised as described in @sec-normalisation above.\n\n\n## Calculation of the InCiSE Index {#sec-calc-index}\n\nThe InCiSE Index is an aggregation of the InCiSE indicators. Ideally, the\nindicators would be combined equally, however in producing the 2017 Pilot\nedition the InCiSE Partners felt it important to consider relative data\nquality. In the 2017 Pilot this was done by placing a lower weight on the\nindicators measuring 'attributes' than those measuring'functions', as the\nfour attribute indicators were considered to generally have lower data quality\nthan those measuring functions. The 2019 edition builds on this approach to\nweighting by using the results of the data quality assessment (section\n@sec-data-quality).\n\nFor this approach to weighting, two-thirds of the weighting is allocated on an\nequal basis, while one third is allocated according to the outcome of the data\nquality assessment. The weight for an indicator is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nw_i = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}*\\frac{1}{n_i}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}*Q_i\\right)\n$$\n\nHere the indicator weight ($w_i$) is equal to the product of two-thirds and\nthe equal share (1 divided by $n_i$, the number of indicators; i.e. 1/12) plus\nthe product of one-third and the data quality weight for the indicator ($Q_i$).\nThe data quality weight is calculated first by summing the data quality scores\nof the 38 selected countries for the indicator. The indicator's data quality\nsum is then divided by the sum of all indicator data quality scores, in essence\nproviding a score that represents that indicator's share of the total data\nquality for the 38 countries selected. The resulting weights are shown in\nTable @tbl-ind-weights.\n\nA country's overall raw index score ($I_c$) is thus calculated as the sum of\nthe product of the normalised indicator scores for the country ($i_c$) with the\nindicator weights ($w_i$):\n\n$$\nI_c = \\sum{(i_c * w_i)}\n$$\n\nAfter calculating the raw index scores, they are then are normalised as\noutlined in @sec-normalisation, resulting in the overall index scores for the\n2019 edition of InCiSE.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ind-weights .cell tbl-cap='InCiSE 2019 indicator weightings'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table

illustrate how the data quality\nassessment described in section @sec-data-quality is used within the InCiSE\nmodel for country selection and indicator weighting.\n\nThe assessment can also be used to help interpret the results of the InCiSE\nIndex, both in terms of the quality of the indicators and for country results.\n\n### Quality of indicators\n\nThe data quality assessment conducts three checks for each indicator: the\navailability of metrics, the (non-)use of wider public sector data as a proxy,\nand the recency of the data. @tbl-dqa-meta summarises the results of these\nthree checks for each of the indicators.\n\nAs discussed in sections @sec-coverage and @sec-imputation there are four\nindicators where at least one country is missing all data for the indicator.\nConversely, there is only one indicator (policy making) where all 38 countries\nhave all data available. When it comes to the use of public sector proxy data,\nthere are six indicators where all the data is not a public sector proxy,\ngiving the indicators a maximum proxy data score of 1, and only two indicators\n(capabilities and digital services) where all the data relates to the civil\nservice and is not public sector proxy which means their maximum proxy score\nis 0. The recency calculation is a relative assessment where the oldest data\n(2012) scored 0 and the most recent data (2018) scored 1 – here we see that\nonly one indicator (policy making) is composed solely of 2018 data and again\nonly one indicator (capabilities) is composed solely of 2012 data.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-dqa-meta .cell .column-page-inset-right tbl-cap='Summary of data quality metadata for

in the\nnumber of countries that achieve the maximum overall data quality score for\neach indicator. For policy making all 38 countries score achieve the maximum\nscore, while for integrity only 14 countries achieve the maximum score.\n\nBesides integrity, three other indicators (crisis & risk management, fiscal &\nfinancial management, and procurement) have less than 20 countries achieving\nthe maximum score, while three indicators besides policy making have more than\n30 countries achieving the maximum score (HR management, inclusiveness, and\nregulation).\n\nThe indicator data quality scores can also be used to create a data-driven\nred-amber-green (RAG) rating for data quality. Using the mean overall data\nquality scores for each indicator from the 38 countries selected for the 2019\nedition of InCiSE, a 'green' rating is assigned to those with a score of 0.75\nor higher, 'amber' to those with a score between 0.25 and 0.75, and 'red' to\nthose with a score below 0.25.\n\nHowever, the data quality assessment does not consider the reliability and\nvalidity of each indicator's construction and therefore says nothing on how\nwell the indicator represents the concept it is trying to measure. Instead,\nthese data-driven RAG ratings can be combined with a subjective assessment of\nwider data quality concerns to make an overall assessment of the general\n'quality' of each indicator. @tbl-rag-rating shows the data quality assessment\nof each indicator alongside a high-level qualitative assessment of the\nindicator and a 'final' subjective RAG rating for the indicator.\n\n\n:::

the indicators have a mean data quality score of 0.75 or higher,\nearning them an initial 'green' rating. Of these indicators, three retain their\ngreen rating after wider considerations of the quality of the indicators are\ntaken into account, meaning that these indicators are considered to provide\nbroad and robust coverage of their respective concepts. Two of the five are\ndemoted from green to amber, reflecting concerns about whether the indicators\nare sufficiently broad.\n\nSix of the indicators have an initial 'amber' rating. Five of these indicators\nretain their rating, meaning they may only provide partial coverage of the\nunderlying concept or be heavily reliant on one particular data source or type\nof data. One of the six is demoted from amber to red, reflecting concerns that\nthe indicator provides limited coverage of the underlying concept.\n\nOne indicator has an initial 'red' rating, which is driven largely by its lack\nof recent data and being solely composed of public sector proxy data. Finally,\nthe social security function, which was included in the 2017 Pilot, is given a\n'red' rating following its removal from the 2019 edition of InCiSE due to data\nquality concerns. This change is discussed further in @sec-changes and\n@sec-future-development.\n\n### Quality of country-level results\n\nCountry-level data quality has already been considered to some degree, through\nthe determination of country selection in @sec-coverage. However, as with the\nquality of indicators, the results of the data quality assessment can be used\nto show the relative quality of the selected countries, which can help improve\ninterpretation of the results of the InCiSE Index.\n\n@tbl-dqa-grade presents a detailed overview of the data quality by country.\nEach country has been given an overall data quality letter \"grade\" based on its\noverall data quality score, and for each indicator each country has been given\na \"RAG\" rating.\n\nThe overall data quality grades are allocated as follows based on a country's\ndata quality score rounded to 2 decimal places:\n\n* **A+** for those countries that achieve the highest overall data quality\n  assessment score (i.e. a data quality score of 0.75 when rounded to 2\n  decimal places)\n* **A** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.7\n  but less than 0.75\n* **B** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.65\n  but less than 0.7\n* **C** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.6\n  but less than 0.65\n* **D** for countries with a data quality score greater than or equal to 0.5\n  but less than 0.6\n \nFor the indicators, a four category \"RAG+\" rating system is adopted. The data\nquality scores have been normalised (using min-max normalisation) by indicator:\n\n* A 'green' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator\n  data quality score of 1 – the country has the best possible data for this\n  indicator.\n\n* An 'amber' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator\n  data quality score of greater than or equal to 0.5 – the country's data\n  quality is at least half as good as the 'best' possible data for that\n  indicator.\n\n* A 'red' rating is given to those countries with a normalised indicator\n  data quality score of less than 0.5 – the country's data quality is less than\n  half as good as the'best' possible data for that indicator.\n\n* An 'X' rating is given to those countries which have no data at all for\n  that metric – that all of the country's scores for the metrics in that\n  indicator have been imputed.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-dqa-grade .cell tbl-cap='Data quality scores by indicator and country'}\n:::

good coverage of\n  data but typically have two or three indicators rated 'amber' or 'red\", only\n  one country has an indicator where all data for that indicator has been\n  imputed (rated'grey').\n* Seven countries achieve a \"B\" rating for data quality – these countries have\n  a greater degree of 'amber' and 'red' rated indicators, typically four. All\n  but one country has at least one 'red' rated indicator, one country has one\n  indicator fully imputed while another has two indicators fully imputed.\n* Ten countries achieve a \"C\" rating for data quality – all countries have at\n  least one 'red' rated indicator and eight of the countries have at least one\n  indicator fully imputed.\n* Seven countries achieve a \"D\" rating for data quality – all countries both\n  have at least one indicator fully imputed and one indicator rated 'red',\n  four countries have at least four indicators rated 'red'.\n\n## Comparisons over time {#sec-time-series}\n\nThe InCiSE project is still in its infancy, and the methodology for the 2019\nIndex has built substantially on the foundations of the 2017 Pilot – most of\nthe metrics used in the 2017 Pilot have continued to be used in the 2019\nedition. Of the 70 metrics in the 2017 Pilot that are directly comparable to\nthe 2019 edition, 33 have since had updates which are incorporated into the\nmodel.\n\nIn addition to the 70 metrics carried over from the 2017 Pilot, a further 46\nmetrics have been incorporated into the InCiSE methodology, bringing the total\nnumber of metrics for the 2019 model to 116. Most of these additional metrics\n(30) are from existing sources. Some have been collected multiple times, but\nsome are new and have no previous data collection. Changes are summarised\nin @sec-changes.\n\nA further consideration for comparisons over time is the need to deal with\ndifferent reference dates and frequencies of updating.\n\nSome data is updated on an annual basis while others are on two-year,\nthree-year, or longer update cycles. For example, the data for capabilities\nhas not been updated since it was first collected in 2012. These differing\ncycles are the function of a variety of different factors, such as an\nappreciation of the pace of change within a given topic area or the funding\nand resourcing of the data producers.\n\nAs outlined in @sec-imputation, the InCiSE model uses imputation methods which\nuse statistical techniques to provide an estimate of a country's missing data.\nWhile the imputation is based on predictive methods, it is not a firm\nprediction of what a given country would have scored, but better understood as\nindicative. The imputation methods may change between years, and the\nrelationships in the observed data (from which the imputation is drawn) may\nalso change, limiting the reliability of comparing data imputed in one year\nwith data imputed in another year.\n\nIt may also be the case that at one time point a country did not have data for\na given metric but then has data at a later time point (or vice versa). This\nwould mean that for one point the metrics would have been imputed.\n\nComparing a score based on 'real' data with one based on imputed estimates is\nunlikely to be reliable. In addition, as the methodology for InCiSE develops,\nfuture versions of the InCiSE Index could adopt back-/forward-casting (i.e.\nusing results from different time points) to improve the quality of the\nimputation methods. This would also make time-series comparison more\ncomplicated or less feasible.\n\nFinally, consideration should be given to the changing country composition.\nThe 2017 Pilot covered 31 countries, while the 2019 edition covers 38\ncountries. As outlined in section @sec-normalisation, the data is normalised\nso that country scores are relative to the group of countries selected. This\nagain means it is not possible to directly compare scores from one edition of\nInCiSE to another as the scores are related to the specific data range and\ncountry set used for that edition.\n\nAs a result of these varied challenges, the InCiSE Partners have decided not\nto include any comparisons between the 2017 Pilot and the 2019 edition of the\nInCiSE Index.\n\nFurthermore, the Partners strongly advise against any direct or indirect\ncomparisons being made beyond references to changes in the underlying source\ndata itself (i.e. before the data is imported into the InCiSE data model,\nprocessed, imputed and normalised).\n\n",
