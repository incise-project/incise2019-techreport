The 2019 edition builds on and strengthens\nthe methodology of the pilot edition. The InCiSE Partners have used a\ncombination of stakeholder feedback, continued engagement with data providers\nand further desk research to develop the methodology for the 2019 edition of\nthe InCiSE Index.\n\nGiven the frequency of data updates and to provide suitable time to reflect\non each edition's results, we propose that future editions of the InCiSE Index\nare repeated on a biennial timescale. This chapter sets out considerations for\nfuture development of the InCiSE methodology.\n\n## Social security administration {#sec-future-ssa}\n\nThe InCiSE framework (described in @sec-incise-framework) identifies social\nsecurity administration as one of the constituent functions of an effective\ncentral civil service, and the 2017 Pilot edition of the InCiSE Index included\nan indicator for social security administration. The indicator was based on a\nsingle metric, which was the administrative costs of social protection as a\nproportion of total social protection expenditure. Feedback from the pilot\nedition included a critique of this metric, saying it was unsuitable given the\ninclusion of state provided healthcare which varies significantly across\ncountries. Furthermore, the data was available solely for European Union\nmember states, so data for non-EU countries was imputed based on correlated\nperception measures from the Quality of Governance study used elsewhere in\nthe InCiSE model.\n\nExploration of the source data did not identify an appropriate method to\nexclude healthcare costs from the calculations. A review of further data\nsources identified neither alternative metrics that included non-EU countries\nnor imputation predictors with a closer intellectual or theoretical\nrelationship to the indicator's conceptual basis.\n\nIt was therefore decided that the social security indicator should be removed\nfrom the 2019 edition of InCISE. For future editions of the InCiSE Index, we\nwill continue to explore whether there is suitable data to reintroduce a\nsocial security indicator.\n\n## Functions and attributes not yet measured {#sec-future-notmeasured}\n\nIn addition to social security, four of the functions and attributes\nidentified in the InCiSE framework have not been measured in either edition\nof the index: IT for officials, internal finance, staff engagement, and\ninnovation. No suitable data has been identified since the pilot that would\nallow for measurement of these four potential indicators. Future editions of\nthe InCiSE index will continue to explore whether suitable data exists to\nintroduce indicators for these four areas.\n\n## Functions and attributes already measured {#sec-future-measured}\n\nThe 2019 edition of InCiSE has used an additional 46 metrics compared to the\n2017 Pilot: six form the new procurement indicator and 40 are distributed\nacross the existing indicators measured in the 2017 Pilot. \n\nWhile this has strengthened a number of indicators, as @tbl-rag-rating shows\nonly three of the indicators have been given a final 'RAG' rating of green\n(data quality score of 0.75 or more). @tbl-indicator-future below provides some\nconsiderations for future improvements of each of the indicators measured in\nthe 2019 edition of InCiSE, with amber or red 'RAG' ratings. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-indicator-future .cell tbl-cap='Potential future improvement of indicators measured in the 2019 edition of InCiSE'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"table\">\n  <thead>\n    \n    <tr class=\"gt_col_headings\">\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"InCiSE indicator\">InCiSE indicator</th>\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_center\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"RAG rating\">RAG rating</th>\n      <th class=\"gt_col_heading gt_columns_bottom_border gt_left\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" id=\"Potential routes for future development\">Potential routes for future development</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody class=\"gt_table_body\">\n    <tr><td headers=\"indicator\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Integrity</td>\n<td headers=\"final_rag\" class=\"gt_row gt_center\"><img src=\"figures/amber-circle.png\" alt=\"Amber\"></td>\n<td headers=\"development_note\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Addition to, or replacement of, existing metrics with non-perception based measures.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"indicator\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Openness</td>\n<td headers=\"final_rag\" class=\"gt_row gt_center\"><img src=\"figures/green-circle.png\" alt=\"Green\"></td>\n<td headers=\"development_note\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">n/a</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"indicator\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Capabilities</td>\n<td headers=\"final_rag\" class=\"gt_row gt_center\"><img src=\"figures/red-circle.png\" alt=\"Red\"></td>\n<td headers=\"development_note\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Identification of data sources with more recent data and/or more regular update frequency.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"indicator\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Inclusiveness</td>\n<td headers=\"final_rag\" class=\"gt_row gt_center\"><img src=\"figures/red-circle.png\" alt=\"Red\"></td>\n<td headers=\"development_note\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Additional metrics providing objective measurement of ethnic/religious diversity, and metrics providing objective/subjective measurement of inclusion for other under-represented groups (e.g. disability, age, socio-economic background, LGBT).</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"indicator\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Policymaking</td>\n<td headers=\"final_rag\" class=\"gt_row gt_center\"><img src=\"figures/amber-circle.png\" alt=\"Amber\"></td>\n<td headers=\"development_note\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Addition of non-perception based measures, including on themes such as timeliness, accuracy, and use of evidence.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"indicator\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Fiscal &amp;

Future editions of the InCiSE Index will continue to use\nthe data quality based approach to country inclusion set out in @sec-coverage,\nhowever this requires greater data availability for non-OECD/EU countries.\n\nThere are a number of potential options, such as creating regional versions\nof the InCiSE Index using existing multi-country data collections for\ndifferent regions (but for which either OECD or EU countries are not members).\nAlternatively, subsets of the existing InCiSE Index could be created as some\nindicators have wider data coverage than others.\n\nThe InCiSE Partners are committed to identifying ways to increase coverage,\nand have conducted two short studies of how the InCiSE framework applies in\nBrazil and Nigeria to inform future thinking. \n\nWhile extending country coverage will generate a greater set of results,\ncareful consideration will be needed on developing alternative versions of the\nindex and how (if at all) to compare between them. \n\n::: {.callout-note .crf title=\"Cross-referencing note\" icon=\"false\"}\n\nThis was presented as chapter 6 in the original 2019 publication.\n\n:::\n",
