This is an HTML version of the InCiSE 2019 Technical Report, originally
published in [April 2019](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/new-index-ranks-uk-civil-service-top-followed-new-zealand-and-canada).

This report provides a detailed discussion of the methodology behind the
InCiSE Index. For the results of the 2019 edition of the InCiSE Index please see
the [Results Report](https://incise-project.github.io/incise2019-results/).

## Preface {.unnumbered}

From 2016 to 2019, the
[International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) project](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/incise)
was a collaboration between the
[Blavatnik School of Government](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk) and the
[Institute for Government](http://instituteforgovernment.org.uk).
It was supported by the UK Civil Service (through the
[Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/cabinetoffice)) and funded by the
[Open Society Foundations](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org).

The Blavatnik School of Government is re-establishing the InCiSE project with
the aim of publishing a new edition of the InCiSE Index in 2024. To support
engagement with stakeholders the School is re-publishing the 2019 project
outputs (this Technical Report, the 
[Results Report](https://incise-project.github.io/incise2019-results/) and
interactive data visualisations) in more modern and user friendly formats.

This HTML version was made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

### Differences from the original 2019 publication

Please note, as part of the re-publication of this report into a web format
Chapter 3 of the original report has had its constituent sections split into
individual chapters to improve readability and navigation. Some typographic
errors have been corrected as part of the re-publication of this report. There
have also been some changes to the tables and figures when compared to the
original report, these are largely for layout purposes (except in the case of
one chart where external source data availability has changed). Footnotes have
been added to charts, tables and chapters to indicate changes in content and
differences in numbering.

You can also download and read the
[original PDF publication](incise2019_technical_report.pdf).

To support the future development of the Index a supplementary appendix was
published in December 2023, @sec-dqa-detailed, that summarises the data quality
results for all countries and territories which have at least one data point
in the data sources that were used by the 2019 InCiSE Index.

## Preface to the original report

Two reports have been published covering the 2019 edition of the InCiSE Index:

* The [Results Report](https://incise-project.github.io/incise2019-results/)
  provides an overview of the overall results of the InCiSE Index, and a
  summary for each country covered by the Index.
* The Technical Report (this report) provides the methodology of the InCiSE
  Index, it includes details fo the data sources, transformations, imputation,
  and weightings.

Users are free to copy, download and print InCiSE content and findings for
their own use. Excerpts from InCiSE reports and publications may also be used,
but must be appropriately referenced.
