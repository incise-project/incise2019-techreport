Civil service functions that deliver services to citizens and organisations directly (e.g. tax and social security administration at the central/ federal level). | A primary focus of the InCiSE framework
Public administration functions of central government (e.g. fiscal management, policy making, regulation) | A primary focus of the InCiSE framework
'Mission support' functions (e.g. HRM and procurement) that support the operation of central government organisations. | A primary focus of the InCiSE framework
Parts of the civil service which direct and support the wider public sector on specific policy areas (e.g. ministries of health or education) but may not deliver services to citizens directly. | Performance captured through the assessment of central government's public administration functions (e.g. policy making, regulation). Performance of policy areas themselves (e.g. quality of healthcare, educational attainment) are not assessed as these are not always the responsibility of central/federal government, moreover the policy goals and policy approaches taken are determined by political decision making. 
Sub-national government/public administration (e.g. regional or local government) | While in some jurisdictions employees of sub-national governments  may be classed as civil servants (e.g. via employment law) the scope of InCiSE is principally with the central/federal level of government in a country/state. However, general government/public administration (incorporating both central and sub-national government) may be used as a proxy where no central-level civil service data is available.
The wider public sector (e.g. schools, hospitals, police forces). | Out of scope. However, public sector data may be used as a proxy where no central-level civil service data is available.
